# Orca2 README

This Python script utilizes PyTorch and Transformers library to interact with a pre-trained language model (Orca-2-7b) for generating answers to multiple-choice questions based on provided text inputs. Below are the key components and functionalities of the code:

## Requirements

- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `transformers`: Library for state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- `json`: Library for handling JSON data.

## Usage

### Importing Libraries

The script begins by importing necessary libraries:
```python
import torch
import transformers
import json
```

### Device Configuration

It checks for the availability of CUDA for GPU acceleration if applicable:
```python
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.set_default_device("cuda")
```

### Question List and Human Answers

The script defines a list of questions and corresponding human answers for two different datasets (`Human_answers2022` and `Human_answers2023`).
```python
question_list = [...]  # List of questions
Human_answers2022 = [...]  # Human answers for 2022 dataset
Human_answers2023 = [...]  # Human answers for 2023 dataset
```

### Loading Model and Tokenizer

It loads the pre-trained Orca-2-7b model and tokenizer from Microsoft:
```python
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/Orca-2-7b")
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Orca-2-7b")
```

### Generating Answers

The script generates answers for each question based on provided text inputs and human answers:
```python
for i in range(0, len(post_list)):
    for j in range(0, 15):
        # Generating answer for each question
```

### Writing Answers to Files

Finally, it writes the generated answers to text files named after the corresponding input file names.

## Note

Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the required model files are downloaded before executing the script.

# Text Processing Script

## Introduction
This script is designed to process text data extracted from files. It performs various operations on the text content to transform it into a desired format.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `re` module (for regular expressions)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python and the required modules are installed.
3. Place the text files to be processed in the specified directory (`C:\\Users\\reihaneh.maarefdoust\\Desktop\\ERisk\\test-llama3-f\\`).
4. Update the file paths in the script (`2023-test-answer-Question{k}.txt` and `clear-2023-test-answer-Question{k}.txt`) according to your file naming convention.
5. Execute the script using Python.
6. The processed text will be written to new files with names prefixed by "clear-" in the same directory.

## Functionality
- The script reads text files from the specified directory.
- It replaces specific strings and patterns in the text with predefined characters or digits.
- Alphabets, newlines, spaces, and certain punctuation marks are removed using regular expressions.
- The processed text is then written to new files.

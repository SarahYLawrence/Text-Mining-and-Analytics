# Text Generation Code README

This repository contains code for generating text using the transformers library. The code includes a pipeline for text generation using a pre-trained model.

## Setup

To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- transformers
- torch

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install transformers torch
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. Run the code:

```python
python text_generation.py
```

Make sure to modify the code as needed and provide appropriate input data.

## Description

The `text_generation.py` script initializes a text generation pipeline using a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face transformers library. It generates text based on input prompts and saves the output to text files.

## Input Data

The code expects input data in JSON format containing text data and file names. The input data should be structured as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Text data goes here...",
    "file_name": "example_file.txt"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Output

The generated text is saved to individual text files based on the input file names. Each file contains the generated text for a specific prompt/question.

## Additional Notes

- The code includes functionality to handle long text inputs by truncating them to a maximum length.
- It also includes logic to handle multi-choice questions and generate appropriate responses based on provided instructions.

Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific use case.

# Orca 2 on Colab

## Introduction
This notebook is based on the article "Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason" by A. Mitra et al. The notebook provides an overview and implementation of Orca 2, a language model developed by Microsoft Research. Orca 2 aims to explore the capabilities of smaller language models through improved training signals and methods.

## Description
Orca 2 is a language model designed to showcase the enhanced reasoning abilities of smaller language models, typically with around 10 billion parameters or less. It outperforms models of similar size and exhibits performance levels comparable to or better than models 5-10 times larger. Orca 2 is fine-tuned on high-quality synthetic data and the weights are made publicly available to encourage further research on smaller LMs.

## Instruction Tuning to Explanation Tuning
Orca 2 employs Explanation Tuning, which involves training student models on richer and more expressive reasoning signals obtained through 'system instructions'. These instructions prompt detailed explanations from a teacher model as it reasons through a task, enhancing the student model's ability to generalize and adapt its reasoning capabilities.

## Teaching Orca 2 to be a "Cautious Reasoner"
Orca 2 employs 'Cautious Reasoning', where the model selects the appropriate solution strategy for a given task among options such as direct answer generation or various 'Slow Thinking' strategies. This approach aims to optimize the model's performance based on the problem at hand.

## Example Code
The notebook provides example code for utilizing Orca 2 using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It demonstrates tokenization, model loading, and generating answers to predefined questions.

## Conclusion
Orca 2 showcases promising potential for smaller language models in achieving enhanced reasoning capabilities. Further research in this direction could lead to advancements in applications involving complex prompts and reasoning tasks.

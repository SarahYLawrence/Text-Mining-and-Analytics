# Orca 2 on Colab

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for running the Orca 2 language model on Google Colab. Orca 2 is a language model from Microsoft Research designed to explore the capabilities of smaller language models through improved training signals and methods.

## Getting Started

To get started with Orca 2 on Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook `Erisk-T3-Orca2.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and interact with the Orca 2 model.

## Overview

The notebook provides an overview of Orca 2, its design principles, and its performance in various reasoning tasks. It also includes example code for using Orca 2 with the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

## Usage

The notebook demonstrates how to:
- Install necessary libraries such as `transformers`, `accelerate`, `SentencePiece`, `protobuf`, and `bitsandbytes`.
- Load the Orca 2 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face.
- Use the Orca 2 model to generate responses to prompts.

## Example Code

The notebook includes example Python code for interacting with the Orca 2 model. It demonstrates how to install dependencies, load the model, tokenize prompts, and generate responses.

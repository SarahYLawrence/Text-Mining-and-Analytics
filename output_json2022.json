I went through a period my freshman year of college (engineering major, so no English classes involved) where I read classic books as part of a personal desire to read more complex  literary novels and it was much more enjoyable.

Depends on the recipe, but usually about 125 grams for 500 grams of ice cream total (about a pint). So I\u2019ll use ~125 g fruit pur\u00e9e and ~375 g ice cream or sherbet base.\n\n3. Yes, I personally don\u2019t like frozen banana chunks. Also it won\u2019t churn well with chunks. If you want to add mix ins it\u2019s better to stir them in after you churn. If you want to use the banana chunks as a mix in I\u2019d make an extra that you can add in at the end. So basically make double the roasted banana: half to steep in the base and discard, half to use as a mix-in at the end. You can also pur\u00e9e the banana and add it to the base, but the extra starches can change the ice cream texture. I\u2019ve personally never tried that, but there are plenty of recipes that use the pur\u00e9e method.",

My basic method is to peel/chop/mash the fruit, simmer about 10 minutes on the stove, pur\u00e9e, then strain out the seeds and pulp.\n\nFor all fruits except banana I add the pur\u00e9e at the time of churning. Just whisk it into your base right before you churn. For banana I like to do the steep overnight method: cook the base, add banana chunks to cooked base and refrigerate overnight.

            "Does the studio actually penalize other students who are late? If they\u2019re unevenly enforcing the rule, and you\u2019ve been affected by that, then feel free to complain to the management about it, but if anyone who\u2019s late still gets let in, or you\u2019ve never been locked out for being late, it\u2019s not really your place to complain.\n\nAs an instructor, yes I prefer my students to be on time, but I\u2019d be really bothered if a student tried to complain about other student\u2019s tardiness on my behalf. It\u2019s really none of their business. Shit happens, as long as you aren\u2019t disruptive when you come in and you take a few extra minutes to fully warm up in it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nThe monopolizing teacher time is tricky. I feel like you can try to talk to your instructor about this, but the chances that they can do anything about it are minimal. Part of this is that the instructor needs to set expectations about when is appropriate to ask for feedback (i.e. if I\u2019m watching or spotting someone else, don\u2019t interrupt me. If a student does interrupt I usually say something like \u201cI\u2019m watching X right now. I\u2019ll help you next.\u201d To highlight that they need to wait.) Also sometimes the instructor knows the student is annoying to others, but can\u2019t really do anything about it since they aren\u2019t doing anything unsafe. As for asking other advanced students to teach her, unless she asks you, it\u2019s not your problem. Either the instructor will address it if it bothers them, or the students she\u2019s asking can bring it up with the instructor.",

Eventually you can move on to contortion classes which work on tricks at the more extreme ranges of flexibility. You can also look for flow arts (fire dancing, poi, hoop dancing) which are similar to the apparatus manipulation in rhythmic gymnastics. I\u2019ve never seen flow arts classes in my area, it seems to be a more community-based thing with jams advertised on Facebook groups or through word of mouth in the circus community. Your local circus schools might be able to direct you to some good resources if you\u2019re interested in that.\n\nAlso as a former gymnast turned pole dancer I totally recommend trying pole.",

I\u2019ve marinated it to make \u201cbacon\u201d (doesn\u2019t really taste like bacon, but has a similar smokiness). Barbecue marinated tempeh is also good. I really like to cook it in Asian recipes in place of meat. It goes great with sweet and sour.\n\nAnother good substitute is lentils. I make a red lentil cacciatore and a green lentil fesenjoon.\n\nBarbecue cauliflower is also a classic. I do it the lazy way where you just steam the cauliflower in the microwave and dip it in the sauce.\n\nFor Mexican style dishes I usually use beans as a substitute.

My flexibility wasn\u2019t great, but I worked really hard at it and eventually achieved moderate oversplits on both sides. It\u2019s really about the effort you put into it.

            "I also am a vegetarian with an anorexia history. When I went vegetarian I was about 4 years into my ED, hovering in the semi-recovered stage.\n\nGrowing up I never really liked meat. I was the child who would eat 3-4 bites of her steak and be done, and only if it was a non-juicy over cooked lump. The only meat dishes I enjoyed were things like tacos and meatballs, where there\u2019s more flavor from the seasoning than the meat. I went vegetarian in college for a couple reasons:\n\n1. I realized it was an option. As silly as it sounds, I never knew it was something you could do for non-religious reasons. I grew up in the South and it just wasn\u2019t a thing at the time. In college I met vegetarians (both religious and not), so I figured I\u2019d try it.\n\n2. I didn\u2019t really like meat. I think it\u2019s gross to cook, most of it didn\u2019t taste great, and the meat stuff in the college dining hall was just gross.\n\n3. I like animals and don\u2019t like killing for no reason. Hunting and fishing for fun have always bothered me. As a kid I used to cry l when I saw the taxidermy hunting trophies.\n\n4.(This is the not so good reason) Purging meat was gross. This wasn\u2019t my only reason. Purging cheese was gross too, but I didn\u2019t give that up. But if I\u2019m being honest, this was part of the reason I went veggie. So, while it was a mostly ED free choice to go vegetarian, it wasn\u2019t entirely. Not that I think that means I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I just think it\u2019s important to be careful. Make sure you\u2019ll still be in recovery if you switch and that this isn\u2019t just a choice to perpetuate your disorder.\n\nI encourage you to honestly evaluate your reasons for going vegetarian. Only you can answer if it\u2019s because of your eating disorder. Even if it\u2019s not part of your eating disorder it\u2019s important to check that it won\u2019t make your disorder worse. For example, I tried to go vegan (for honest animal rights reasons), but I found myself obsessing and feeling guilty over food and it started to trigger ED behaviors. So, my balance is vegetarian is fine for me, but vegan is too far, at least for my current state of recovery. Protecting your health is important. It doesn\u2019t make you a bad person if you can\u2019t go vegetarian or vegan or whatever because it would hurt your mental health.

Kinda like how people who have a limb amputated can have \u201cphantom limbs\u201d where they still feel the presence of the lost appendage, we have phantom weight where we feel like our body has its old weight still on it even though it\u2019s gone",

I\u2019ve talked about it with my therapist,  it seems like the stigma around mental illness for that age group, plus the stigma and disbelief that males could have eating disorders, all make it even harder to approach the subject. I feel like the best thing you could do for your father is offer to listen  support him. Maybe you could bring it up in terms of how it effects you, maybe by saying it impacts your Ed recovery,  then he\u2019d feel less like you were accusing him of anything.

            "So sorry to hear that your daughter is struggling like this, her story reminds me a lot of my own.\n\nI think the first thing you need to do is sit down with your husband,  make sure you\u2019re on the same page about what you\u2019re observing with your daughter, which can serve as a basis for a much needed discussion about refraining from talking about weight ( weight loss), or making comments about how much/how little she\u2019s eating, all of which can be incredibly triggering for someone with an ED.\n\nAs for helping your daughter transition to college, In my own experience, the college environment exacerbated my ED in many ways, but it also facilitated an amazing support network in recovery. Most schools offer free therapy to students, which is something that I think your daughter could really benefit from. I\u2019m not if this is as common, but my school had a nutritionist who students could meet with via appointment, and  if your daughter is open to it, this could be an additional support for her, should she need it.\n\nAs for your marriage, if it were me, I\u2019d decide to do whatever made me happiest, because the best thing for your daughter is having a loving and supportive family, regardless of whether you provide it separately, or as a couple. My parents got divorced when I was in highschool,  while it was hard for me to deal with it at first, coming home to a happy, attentive parent, versus coming home to a screaming match  a household full of chaos  resentment, made the divorce the best thing for everyone,  sometimes I wish it had happened earlier so I hadn\u2019t grown up with that kind of turbulence around. They say the best way to treat a child\u2019s anxiety is to treat their parents\u2019,  I think this yields true for families in general- we internalize the feelings of those closest to us more than we realize,  it influences our behavior.\n\nLastly, I think it might be helpful for both you  your husband to meet with a therapist that specializes in treating people with eating disorders, so you can learn more about what your daughter may be struggling with. My father worked w someone like this,  he learned a lot about what was  wasn\u2019t appropriate to say  do around me regarding food/ED stuff. He also got to unpack a lot of his own issues surrounding food  weight, which definitely contributed to my own ED struggles. I think because of the situation your describing with your husband and his families\u2019 history with ED\u2019s, this could be really useful for everyone involved. At the end of the day,  no parent or family can really be perfect, and while a messy house might symbolize some of what\u2019s going on below the surface, cleaning the house will not address the preponderant issue.\n\nI hope that this helps,  it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re such a caring  loving mother. Your daughter is very lucky to have someone like you in her life. Best of luck to you both \ud83d\udc99",

For me, it honestly feels like my ED has wreaked so much daily havoc on me that i feel strange  uncomfortable if I\u2019m not suffering. Because of that, I kinda feel like the reason I get intense urges to do ED shit after doing something healthy is my subconscious misinterpreting the unfamiliar feeling as some sort of threat, which it combats by trying to restore things to their regular state of misery, since it feels most normal to me to feel disordered.

Once access to food is restored, the body goes into overdrive in terms of eating because it\u2019s trying to replenish itself, but also to quickly gain excess weight so the next time food is scarce, the body can rely on its reserves for energy and has a better chance for survival.

These days I\u2019m so underweight that I\u2019m lighter than every guy I know but somehow I still manage to feel fat occasionally. so it\u2019s probably good to keep in mind that this vision of how we think it\u2019ll feel when we\u2019re ~skinni~  has no basis in reality as it is an unattainable fantasy",

I use my ed to avoid dealing w stuff a lot of times, or even just because I\u2019m bored, so if I\u2019m binging for those reasons, appetite suppressants aren\u2019t a good fix since hunger isn\u2019t my problem",

In my experience, I often use my ed to cope with difficult/stressful things, and having people I can rely on gives me an alternative and healthier way of coping. I\u2019m still not 100% committed to recovering either, so know you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and the fact that your friends clearly care a ton about you shows you\u2019re not alone in real life either \ud83d\udc95",

When I\u2019m feeling alone what helps w the issue is if I specifically bring it up to whoever I\u2019m tryna talk about it with and tell them how they can help (ex:I\u2019m feeling super overwhelmed with my Ed right now, can I vent/ can you give me advice, etc). It helps people out to get some direction for how best they can be there for you, and at least it\u2019s a start",

I\u2019ve never been unattractive or overweight but it\u2019s very apparent that being underweight is favored by most guys, and definitely by the more attractive guys.

It\u2019s def scary in the moment, so it\u2019s okay to worry, just gotta let your body do its thing and remember that this is only temporary",
            "I work with a nutritionist, though I\u2019m not really in recovery, and it is helpful in understanding the process of eating and healthy food choices. I was kinda forced into it (my college doctor notified the school about how underweight I was and I had the choice between seeing their nutritionist or taking a compulsory medical leave), but I found it to be a mostly positive experience. My nutritionist took my weight and asked me about my eating patterns, and after the first meeting she recommended I start drinking ensure in order to increase my calorie intake without shocking my digestive system too much. After the first meeting, taking my weight and blood pressure became a routine followed by me telling her about what I was eating and how I felt about it, and then she would advise me on strategies for ways I could improve how I ate, and what I ate. For me, it was helpful in that I had more information, it felt more like advice than her telling me what I had to do, so i think the extent to which it will help you depends on whether you\u2019ll take it on board. It sounds like you\u2019re committed, and that\u2019s v impressive so I hope my experience can help shed some light on the subject, and I hope things continue to work out for you \ud83d\udc95",
            "I think that the inability to remember what being happy feels like can be a symptom of depression. I know from my own experience that malnutrition can often times result in poorer mental health, because often times I simply don\u2019t have the energy to feel happy (or really any emotions). For me the worst of it wasn\u2019t necessarily sadness or distress, it was more like I felt numb and exhausted. While I still have a raging ed, I\u2019ve been working on living (aka spending less time dwelling in my ed behavior) rather than just doing the bare minimum and honestly, the more time I spend with friends, or doing things I enjoy, plus actually doing my work/hw (when school was still a thing) the better I have felt about life as a whole. I know how apathetic an Ed can make you feel when it consumes all your time and energy, so you\u2019re definitely not alone, and I still feel like that sometimes, though it really helped me when I re-evaluated the extent to which I let it reign over the other areas of my life. I think having a balance worked in my favor, so if not in a place where recovery is something you want, I found that just engaging with things beyond it helped me and it could help you too",
            "I totally get where you\u2019re coming from, having an eating disorder is such an isolating condition already, so having it\u2019s legitimacy questioned, and frankly reinforced by whoever made that Oreo comment (wtf!), gives you every right to feel exasperated. My ed situation is a little different, but I\u2019ve def dealt with some similar issues with having people say things to me about how I look perfectly healthy (I\u2019m underweight) and that I eat a normal amount (I don\u2019t eat most days, and if I do eat I binge and then purge), so they can\u2019t believe that anyone would be concerned about me possibly having an eating disorder, and even though this is usually meant in a complimentary way, having my ed struggle erased by how some else perceived me is possibly the most aggravating thing about it. Having people dismiss your pain due to ignorance and baseless assumptions regarding your situation is truly cruel, and I really hope you know that weight has very little to do with most eating disorders (it can be an indicator, but it\u2019s no where near the full story), and your experience is absolutely valid. The only thing that shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously in this ordeal are the opinions of people who clearly don\u2019t understand what having an eating disorder is like",
            "Yes absolutely! There\u2019s an enormous difference between how society and the media portray eating disorders, and what they actually are. Even as a teenager with an Ed, I was always a little shocked by how glamorous Ed\u2019s were made out to be, and I think that when I first developed it part of myself was clinging to that portrayal because the idyllic and tragic illusion of Ed\u2019s do a way better job of seducing you into the illness than the reality. Obviously developing an eating disorder is a lot more complex and nuanced than just choosing to starve yourself because tv made it look good, but I do think that society\u2019s preoccupation with thinness very much reinforces it to some extent",
            "Lol same! I\u2019ve never even slightly been unsure about whether I had an Ed. I think those that feel like they\u2019re faking it are probably those that have less obvious symptoms where they have a few \u201cnormal\u201d eating days or something like that but for those of us who exhibit their Ed everyday we\u2019re too far down the rabbit hole at this point. I def sympathize with those who feel \u201cfake\u201d because that sounds horrible in its own right, and while I am definitely suffering due to my inability to stop my ed behavior, I also feel empowered by the identity and the solidarity I have with these Ed communities that help me cope and vent. So while it def sucks that I struggle with it literally every single day, I think it might be worse to feel like I didn\u2019t fully belong because without this, I would truly feel alone",
            "I\u2019m not a therapist, or a medical professional but I think the fact that you\u2019re on this sub in the first place asking the question kind of answers it. In my own experience I first realized I had an Ed when food and the lack of started to become my greatest priority, to the effect that I would neglect or diminish other areas of my life to maintain restrict; for example I would cancel plans with friends if they involved food, or skip class because I didn\u2019t have the energy to get out of bed because I couldn\u2019t sleep since I was so hungry at night. Only you know how severe the issue is, but I often experienced minor periods of my life where I would restrict majorly for a couple months then go back to normal for years until my eating disorder came back years later and never left. The sooner you identify that you have this issue, though, the easier it is to get help and recover, so it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re seeking help because if you resolve the issue (maybe try therapy?)  now before it gets out of control, you can prevent yourself from becoming entirely consumed by it. It\u2019s a lot easier to fix a bad habit after a brief time, than it is to fix after years of living with an eating disorder, and since you\u2019re so young right now, getting help could save you from the severe effects of malnourishment like hair loss and health determination. I know it probably is starting to take a toll on you so I hope you can figure out a way to get help now \ud83d\udc95",
            "I totally feel this! Last year I literally skipped Thanksgiving with my fam so I could stay in my dorm and dedicate the holiday to letting my ed self thrive. I def have learned that unless I set some boundaries for myself, I am unable to be a decent and functioning human being, and one of those boundaries is that I never allow myself to bail on friends/fam/boyfriend (or school stuff) to do ED things. Unless I hold myself to that, I get into a dark spiral, and usually the more I force myself to live my actual life, the less power my Ed has over me. I agree that having an eating disorder can lead to acting selfishly, just remember that the person mainly afflicted and harmed by it is you, so try not to beat yourself up to much",
            "Hahaha I would willingly sell my soul to be able to just \u201cforget\u201d about eating or food in general. Like for someone who is as undernourished and who eats like once a day or not at all for the majority of the year, it\u2019s insane how much I think about it so the ability to not even remember to eat seems like a super power lmao but honestly it\u2019s probably good that I don\u2019t have that cuz I already know I\u2019d abuse the shit outta that",
            "I feel like EDs don\u2019t necessarily mean you came from a bad environment. From what I\u2019ve experienced and heard from others, it\u2019s a combination of environmental behavior, genetic predispositions, and what values you develop and internalize. Parents don\u2019t have to be awful people to play a role in your Ed, and I would argue that this is way more widespread in our society than people think. For me, my parents were largely great parents but they did indoctrinate me with the belief that it wasn\u2019t okay to show emotion, not because they told me that explicitly but I watched them never cry, or fully express their negative feelings and now I resort to Ed behaviors when I want to avoid or suppress negative emotions in my life today. No family is perfect and there\u2019s more than one way they can teach good and bad things",
            "I def know that feeling :( luckily from a nondisordered viewpoint its probably good that you\u2019re not starving yourself to an untimely death? Idk if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re able to appreciate, cuz I know I\u2019m not really one to talk because I literally will read an article about someone dying from an Ed and I\u2019ll be lowkey jealous but I also know that as disordered as I am I still have moments of clarity when I realize that success for my ed is exactly what most people are most afraid of eventually facing",

The second someone starts mentioning hunger or not eating, even if they\u2019re just complaining, my disordered ass is like oh you haven\u2019t eaten all day and you\u2019re starving? Challenge accepted. It\u2019s so bad that anytime anyone i know mentions that they\u2019re trying out a new diet/trying to eat healthier I get PISSED cuz I know that this means that now I\u2019m on a diet too \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "Wow I\u2019m surprised to hear this mostly because I\u2019m tall for a girl 5\u20198/5\u20197 and part of the reason i feel like I have to be underweight is that I feel huge already since there\u2019s so much more of me. Ive always been pretty jealous of my shorter female friends who I feel like are so small already that it won\u2019t matter if they\u2019re a normal weight, while for me, I feel like unless I\u2019m severely underweight I can\u2019t be \u201ccute\u201d or \u201ctiny\u201d or feel feminine. I\u2019ve come to accept my height for the most part and a lot of times I\u2019m p confident about it but I\u2019m still anorexic as hell so not sure if there\u2019s any real solution to either of our problems but since we can\u2019t change our height, and it\u2019s clear that height doesn\u2019t fix how we feel, I\u2019d rather focus on things I can change",
            "Yup! I started purging after a long period of restriction and fasting because I kept ending up in situations where I was forced to eat, but I didn\u2019t want to gain back the weight that I\u2019d worked so hard to lose and 2 years later I purge almost everyday. I occasionally go through phases where I will binge but for the most part I consider myself anorexic and not bulimic because of that and the fact that I purge solely to continue restricting",
            "I lost my period last fall up until recently because I\u2019ve been trying to gain weight (enough so my parents don\u2019t commit me, but not enough to get above being underweight). I\u2019m not really trying to recover, I\u2019m more trying to limit the extent to which I am harming myself, so it\u2019s possible to get your period back without fully recovering",
            "I recently learned from my ed therapist that one way I use my eating disorder is to avoid/cope with my life, responsibilities, and feelings which is an avoidance tactic because I feel powerless or like I\u2019m losing control. After reading your post, it kinda reminded me of this because like you described, I feel like I\u2019m losing control of a lot, which oftentimes reinforces my ed because I\u2019m coping with the fallout it causes, too. Lol glad I\u2019m not the only one who feels like this, and it\u2019s encouraging to hear that there are healthy avenues to this feeling (recovery) rather than my strategy (being extra anorexic to avoid the problems my ed self created lmao)",
            "I used to be slightly underweight but just anorexic, and then transitioned into purging anything I ate but occasionally binging and purging and that eventually lead to me becoming severely underweight. I think after a while your body slows down digestion, which probably leads to less calorie absorption prior to purging, meaning that you end up purging more calories than you absorb. I agree that the weight loss is nice but overtime I\u2019ve basically ruined food for myself because unless I fast all day before I eat, I literally cannot eat a normal sized meal and feel \u201cfull\u201d after, like now unless Im in pain from the amount of food in my stomach, it feels so unsatisfying and not worth the trouble",
            "I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re from, but in the US they can\u2019t send you to an Ed treatment center without your consent since you\u2019re 18. However, if they believe that you are a danger to yourself, they could force you into a 24 hour psych hold, but this wouldn\u2019t include force feeding, and I doubt they would do that to someone who\u2019s in need of the medical care you\u2019re currently undergoing. In most states, the only way you could be force fed without your consent is if your parent or doctor/social worker went before a judge and petitioned for guardianship. In order to do this, they would need a lawyer to make the case that you\u2019re too sick to be capable of making responsible medical decisions on behalf of yourself, and then the judge would need to assess your mental and physical state by consulting psychologists and doctors, and if your assessment convinced the judge that you\u2019re not of sound mind, then they would grant the petition and temporary guardianship to either a family member or social worker which would then give that person the authority to allow you to be force fed. Because this process is lengthy, costly to both the state and hospital, and relies on multiple opinions, it is highly unlikely that this would happen unless the doctors believe that it is a life or death decision, and that you are in immediate danger. Since your parents aren\u2019t involved, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that any of this would happen. I\u2019m not a lawyer or anything so def double check the laws specific to your location! Also, I\u2019m truly sorry you\u2019re having such a hard time right now, and I hope that this gives you enough of an answer that you have one less thing to worry about",
            "Lol we\u2019re a lot alike! I normally mention that I had a snack earlier or that I don\u2019t like eating breakfast in the morning because I\u2019m not hungry. As for the purging part, you could always say you\u2019re pulling trigger, or say you wanna shower before bed and then you could play loud music and turn the shower on to cover it up? Goodluck!!",
            "People are surprisingly unobservant about others eating habits, so in all likelihood, your friend probably won\u2019t think anything of it. People familiar with ED\u2019s are good at recognizing it in others, but the general population is pretty clueless dw :)",

I\u2019ve had times where ive felt like this too, and I know it\u2019s hard to see yourself as more than just a body, and life can feel almost impossible when it\u2019s like this. I\u2019ve struggled with this a lot and when I do, it always helps me to remember all the other strengths I have beyond my appearance and if that fails, I just try to live and go about my routine (read, or draw, or talk to friends, etc) because once I get out of my head, I start to see the bigger picture and that life has many parts of it that don\u2019t involve my appearance and my feelings about how I look. I know it\u2019s difficult to do that rn, it does help though.

It\u2019s so easy to binge and purge when I literally have nothing else to do but every time I do the next day I wake up hungry and the second I eat the cycle starts again. I\u2019m also trying to discontinue it and the best thing I\u2019ve found is finding distractions that occupy my time and keep me away from the kitchen. My main thing right now is making art  and exercise or just going outside but really anything you can do to get your mind out of that place helps. It\u2019s such a tiring cycle and the more exhausted you are (mentally and physically) the harder it is to resist so I\u2019d recommend trying as hard as you can to get a better sleep schedule because once you do that it\u2019s a lot easier to get the energy to do literally anything else.

            "You are a really caring brother and your sister is really lucky to have someone like you with her during what is probably a very hard time in her life. Having an eating disorder is challenging mentally because your mind is telling you things that you logically know are wrong, and after awhile you end up feeling physically weak, which can make it even harder to fight. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re very worried about her health, and I think the best thing you can do is to show that to are there for her and that you are willing to support her. It might be helpful for you to read up on eating disorders so you can learn more about what she\u2019s going through. It sounds like she might not be ready to get help, because many people with eating disorders struggle with not wanting to change, and if that\u2019s her case the best thing you can do is listen until she\u2019s ready to get better. It might also be helpful to find a therapist or another professional who deals with eating disorders because they\u2019re the best resource in this case. I hope this was somewhat helpful and I really hope your sister stays safe",

If I were you, I\u2019d tell your mother that you are already seeking help, but you want to do it at your own pace and if she wants to help you, you need her to accept that this will only be successful if you do it on your own.

The reason you\u2019re so hungry is because after you restrict for a while (esp if it\u2019s to an underweight BMI), once your body starts getting the nutrients it desperately needs, your survival instincts go into overdrive. Your body can\u2019t tell the difference between a famine and anorexia so anytime you stop eating for long periods of time, once you start eating your body will tell you to keep eating as much as you can because it doesn\u2019t know when you\u2019ll have access to food again. Eventually, your body will readjust to regular nourishment and your weight will stabilize as long as you listen to your body\u2019s signals",

I think if you focus too hard on making your Ed the fault of one moment or person, than you miss out on a lot of things that aren\u2019t your fault, and may further influence Ed behavior if you don\u2019t address them, or learn to move past them",

Since giving blood also weakens your immune system potentially, I think you should reconsider donating.

People will come and go, and it won't be because of you, but because they wanted to leave. Maybe they just want a change in their life so they just decide to stop talking to some poeple.

I would hate whenever I would have to present something for class because all I could see is people staring at me.\n\nBut yeah, I definitely get how this feels, maybe it's not exactly the same way that you feel, but I can kind of understand the feeling.",
            "Yess, that song is so good.",
            "Choke by IDKH?",
            "dude, that's not cool.",
            "Oh sure, I wouldn't mind makin some new friends. Ok not very good with conversations though if you don't mind that. But yeah, maybe we can recommend each other some animes as well.",
            "I have but it was only a bit of everything. A bit of dragon ball, a bit of one panch man, assassination classroom, attack on titan, and right now I'm watching kurokos basketball. I still have to finish watching the other ones though.",
            "Definitely listen to some songs by current joy. Become the warm jets, kids, and a different age are my favorite songs.",
            "It's a pretty sad anime. Some people said that they can't even watch it a second time because of how sad it is. But it's a pretty good movie and is even based on a true story.",
            "Oh yeah, I heard it's pretty good. Have you ever watched grave of fireflies?",
            "No, I haven't been able to watch it although I've been meaning to.",
            "It's pretty good, I highly recommend it.",
            "Pretty much about a headless horse rider searching for her head. There's also some other cool characters that she meets along her way.",
            "I do, my favorite anime is durarara.",
            "It's alright dude, I thought she called you a girl too when I first read that sentence.",
            "Hell girl is the anime.",
            "Happy cake day!",
            "Is it a granola bar? If it's a granola bar then I don't mind.",
            "You've ruined my day. I can't get that image out of my head nowm",
            "Oh thanks, I hope things get better for you as well.",
            "Happy birthday, I hope you have a wonderful day.",
            "You don't really have to prove anyone anything, especially not by hurting yourself. I'm not really sure if this helps but I once read that someone used ice cubes you help with that kind of urge.",
            "I think it's alright to post it in here as well.\nI can kind of relate, I'm 19 and pretty much never had a job either. I can't talk over the phone most of the time, I've been stuck in my room for years now. I don't really leave the house or talk to people face to face, I start to feel really panicked for some reason. I need to go and apply for a job as well and I really want one so I can get out of the house that I live in, but I'm kind of stuck as well. I have no motivation and feel really stressed out looking through the jobs that are near me since most of them require experience or petty much dealing with costumers. I know for sure that I'll end up having panick attacks if I get the jobs that address available near me. So yeah, it's a bit stressful.\n\nAlso, you'd be surprised at the amount of people that would actually read all of your story and reply. I got a bit of second hand embarrassment from reading this honestly, I feel so bad for the whole puking part, and on your friends birthday.",
            "I went through something similar to this. It started out with me being nice to him in the beginning as well. He pretty much would hug or try to hug me every single day and time that he would see me. I told him that iI didn't really feel comfortable with him doing that yet he still kept doing it. Just be honest with him and if he ignores it and keeps bothering you like that then be a bit more strict with him or distance yourself if you can.",
            "I guess, but thanks for telling me a bit about yourself. It was nice how you could relate so much about the whole mother thing. Of course it's not a good thing itself but yeah.",
            "Thanks, I don't really think that I am though, I'm much of a hypocrite. You seem like a pretty cool person as well. I hope you have a good day/night.",
            "That's alright, I wish you luck.",
            "Oh yeah, I'm running out of ideas as well, sometimes I just go over some dreams that I've already made up and pretty much just relive them.",
            "I don't really have any goals or see myself doing anything in the future. I don't have any motivation or find any enjoyment anymore. I don't really think that I have strength, the only reason why I get through the days is because I spend them sleeping. I pretty much have like my own little world, which I would always go to whenever I sleep. It's really comforting at times but it can also feel terrible.",
            "Oh hey, I'm pretty much in the same boat. I don't even leave my house anymore since there are a lot of people near where I live. I always wear jackets or hoodies whenever I go outside and pretty much just cover my whole body from neck to toe, even if it's hot out. I also can't tie up my hair because I feel like I look weird or that people would look at me so I always have it down to cover my face.",
            "Yeah, I feel that way too, like I'm just falling further and further into a pit. I don't really want to even exist either but I promised someone that I wouldn't do anything like that. That's pretty much the only reason why I'm still here.\n\nI know this is something that you probably don't want to hear and I kniw it's kind of not right for me to say this but I hope things don't work out and that you keep living. It's hard and life is pretty crappy and miserable but I know that good days will come as well, they always do. I hope you get to take better care of yourself and heck I need to do that as well. I've pretty much been making myself sick just so I can stay in a hospital for a few days so I could have some privacy.",
            "Same, I mean she really is a good mother but when it comes to these kinds of things, it's just not much of a good idea, but I really do love her though. I know that she's always there for me.\n\nI also lied to my doctors as well. I didn't really think that I should say anything just in case I mess things up. I wanted the help before but now I don't even want to seek professional help cause I feel like there's no point.",
            "The last time I tried to tell her about how I felt I just couldn't, I've bottled things up for so long that I literally can't say how I feel because I always end up crying. Sometimes I don't even remember why I'm like this or why I feel the things I feel. That's pretty much what happened then. I tried telling her but I just couldn't and she literally just kept telling me to tell her what was wrong over and over again even though I kept telling her that I just couldn't. I felt so terrible that day that I wished I didn't say anything.",
            "Duddddeee, literally the same. She always tells me how I can always trust her with anything but then she pulls stuff like that. Like what does she expect from me when she always says stuff like that.\n\nShe also does this thing where like she tries to make everyonethink like we are all happy. All of my brothers have gone through depression and some still are, but we don't really talk about things with anyone and usually just keep things to ourselves.",
            "Right, if I say I feel dizzy or if I'm not feeling well she always says it's because I'm in my room all the time. Every time I complain about something hurting she always says that it's because I'm always sleeping. I literally stopped telling her how I feel because she always yells at me and tells me the same thing every time.",
            "My mom too, except I'm always in my room and never leave the house. My mom wants me to go to college because she things that that's going to fix my mental problems or something like that. But school is pretty much the reason why I'm like this now, she doesn't really understand that. I feel really panicked around people and she usually just says how going to college or getting a job will help me. She tells me how it's all just in my head and that there's no point of being upset when I have such a good life.\n\nShe's a good mother but just like yours, she's not very good when it comes to mental health problems. She can say some pretty harsh things at times as well.",
            "Oh, that sounds a lot like my mom.",
            "Have you ever thought about moving out?",
            "Oh, that's pretty messed up. If they want you to do well they should at least try to help you out.",
            "Do you live with your parents? Also why should they overwork you, are they like strict or something?",
            "That really sucks, you can't quit it either right? You'll have to pay for it.",
            "Why not just take one class that will require you to do less work and maybe more activities?",
            "Is there no way of switching back?",
            "How much of your day does university take from your day?",
            "It's there no way that you can take a break from uni and just take some time for yourself? Sometimes you just need to lay down and take some time for yourself every now and then.",
            "Do you know what's causing you so much stress?",
            "Then they are some pretty bad friends to not take you seriously like that.\n\nWhen do you usually get meltdowns? Like when you are around a lot of people or when you are stresses out?",
            "Maybe they think you aren't serious? They might act Like that now but later realize how serious you were and regret their actions. My mom tends to react that way sometimes, she yells at me or my brothers when we say things like that but I think it's because she thinks we are joking.\n\nNo mother would want her son to hurt themselves, no matter how much trouble they might make.\n\nIf you feel like you are being ignored maybe you can talk to your parents about that, they should at least know how you feel.",
            "I'm not saying this to try to help cause I know that there is no way that I can. I was just asking just in case you might want someone to talk to, and I'm sure you aren't a burden to anyone.\n\nYou kind of remind me of my older brother, I feel like that's something that he would think, and I know for sure that I would never think of him as a burden.",
            "I can't really say it's for sure since I'm not there but I feel like your mom would prefer you talking to her about how you feel rather than finding out you hurt yourself from someone else. If you don't feel good about talking to her then if you'd like we could talk. I'm not very good with conversations or comforting people but I'll gladly hear you out or stay up talking if it'll make you feel better.",
            "Oh well good for you, and it's kind of a cool coincidence that you received that message on the same day you thought about leaving.",
            "Good for you, don't let them push you around like that. Treat yourself to some sweets or something. You definitely deserve it.",
            "Did you just call me a mom? Lol, that reminds me of some online friends I used to have, they would call me mom because I would always ask if they ate something. Thank you for that, I feel a bit more cheered up now.\n\nHave a good day, and make sure to have something to eat as well.",
            "My eyes are not very good, I don't think that I'll even be able to see a bit with the lights off.",
            "That's kind of cool.",
            "How do you even see? Do you just know everything from memory?",
            "You shower with the lights off?",
            "Anything by:\n\nSurf curse- freak\n\nTiny little houses- anything by them really\n\nCage the elephant- cigarette daydream\n\nCirca waves- anything by them but their videos can be pretty strange.\n\nPassenger- a song for the drunk and broken hearted\n\nCurrent Joys- become the warm jets\n\nKeaton Henson- his songs are pretty depressing yet calming.\n\nThe Drums- money\n\nSufjan Stevens- fourth of july\n\nThere's also this youtuber named \"I'm cyborg but that's okay\" and that person has some pretty good songs that you can listen to.",
            "This is so cute.",
            "This is literally all that I wish for my birthday. Just to have at least one night alone in a hotel room where I can have some privacy and spend some time alone. I don't even want any presents or cake or even a happy birthday from anyone honestly. Just some time for myself could be the best thing that anyone has ever given me.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Well it's good that you have friends. It must be terrible to have to worry about them leaving you though. I guess try to make the most of it and try not to think about that too much. It's good to focus on the present rather than the future at times.",
            "oh heck if only we would have gone to the same school, I would have given you snacks almost every day. Also I was pretty much considered the weird quiet kid as well except in high school.\n\nThey are just missing out on awesome people like us, that's too bad for them. lol",
            "Thank you, remember to eat at least one meal a day.",
            "Man that really sucks, I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Kids can honestly be terrible at times. I can relate with the whole copying homework issue as well. I was pretty smart in middle school as well and people that usually wouldn't talk to me would always come to me whenever it came to work or snacks. Me being the dumb pushover that I was, would give them all of the work that I was doing while they were messing around and talking during class. It's Honestly better to not have friends other than to have people that are your friends just so they can get something from you.\n\nDo you think they assumed that you were rasict because you were white and quiet?",
            "Yeah it really is. I feel like when I get my own house I'll end up saving a whole ton of money since I don't really plan on buying much furniture or food.",
            "I grew up with friends but I was the total opposite of what I am now. I was always cheerful and was pretty much a people pleaser since that's how I usually knew how to keep people around. But ever since I reached high school I started to get really depressed and that's when pretty much everyone started to ignore me. I even wished that I grew up not knowing them since these were the same friends I had for like 4 or 5 years.\n\nHow come you grew up without friends? If you don't mind me asking. Were you just really shy or introverted?",
            "True, I sleep a lot since it's pretty much comfort for me so I don't really feel all that hungry. Sometimes when I do feel hungry I just go back to sleep until I no longer feel it.",
            "oh that's pretty cool, teaching yourself something new is always a good thing to do. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you get to have better days.",
            "It's no problem, I hope your day gets better. I'm not really sure if this will help but whenever I have bad days I take the time to do something for myself like curl up in a blanket and watch a movie. Maybe you can try that of you'd like?",
            "I remember feeling this way through my high school years. I would walk with my friends in the halls or whenever we went out to go to a gas station near by to buy some snacks. I was going through a hard time back then and I started to grow quieter and quieter.\n\nI thought about this a lot, that if I just went and walked the opposite direction and just disappeared from their view they wouldn't even notice or even ask me where I'm going., and it was honestly true. Sometimes I would wonder off and see if they noticed and they honestly just kept walking, wouldn't even look back to see if I was there. That's when I pretty much realized that it didn't matter if I was with them or not. I guess they just stopped thinking that I was fun or something, maybe thats why friends kind of just part ways.",
            "How are you doing today? I hope that you are doing alright and please make sure you eat well.",
            "It's alright to cry if you need to. I'm not really sure why people say that crying makes you weak or it makes a guy seem less manly. Just cry if you have to, bottling things up is not worth the trouble.\n\nI used to do that a lot when I was in high school. Now whenever I try to talk about my problems all I do is cry and can never speak about the things that I want to say. If you feel too embarrassed about it then maybe go somewhere secluded. It's good to cry every now and then, it'll help you feel better.",
            "Also happy early birthday! I hope you have a good day.",
            "Maybe drop some hints, like leaving a calender somewhere where they might see it or something like that.",
            "I would love to see that, sounds like fun.",
            "That's actually pretty cool and interesting, where did you learn that?",
            "If you check online, it says to picknthe correct answers through day 9 and by day 10 to prioritize your own safety over the RFA members.",
            "I'm not really sure what to say but I hope that you get to feel better and that tomorrow will be a better day for you. Why don't you try doing something for yourself like grabbing some snacks and putting on a movie while being wrapped up in a blanket. I'm not sure if it'll help but it might make you feel better.",
            "It's no problem. Good luck.",
            "As long as you keep telling him that you and rika aren't the same and you don't flirt with the other characters too much you are fine.",
            "No motivation, feeling disappointed in myself, and lose happiness in seconds.",
            "I'm sure she did. If you are unsure why don't you try asking her yourself to confirm things?",
            "I don't think that it would annoy her, if she said to ask if you would like for to go with you then ask. I'm sure she would be more than happy to help you out. Don't hesitate and ask. Also it's not weird to have a teacher's number, it just means that she trusts you and that she wants to help out as much as she can.",
            "In glad to hear that. I'm proud of you and good job for putting things into perspective. Remember to always take time for yourself alright? I how you have a wonderful day/night.",
            "Try to do as much as you can. If the teachers ask why you aren't finish them then just tell them that they aren't giving you enough time. It honestly sucks having to feel so stressed over these kinds of things, especially when the teacher won't even listen to you. Maybe even just try to get a high enough grade that you could pass the class with and only try to get a higher grade if you think that you can. That's what I basically did, it's not all that good but it'll at least get you to pass the class.",
            "Why thank you, so do you. I hope that you are feeling better by now.",
            "Hi, I'm having problems with depression and anxiety as well. I haven't really gone to college yet because I'm trying somewhat mentally prepare myself for it and I may not know how it would feel like to drop out from it but it sounds tough. I'm not very sure what to say but I just wanted to let you know that if you ever want some company or someone to talk to, I'll gladly hear you out. Although in not very good with conversions but I do try.\n\nI know that living can be kind of difficult and I know how it feels like to pretty much not want to exist but I hope that you keep trying, and that things get at least a bit better for you.",
            "I don't know what's going on but take a break, relax. Grab some snacks and a blanket and watch a movie or some videos. Everything will be alright, take some time for yourself and relax a bit. I'm not very good with conversations but if you need to talk to someone let me know. I'll gladly hear you out.",
            "I went through the same thing when I was in high school. I pretty much lost all motivation to do my work and when the whole pandemic thing happened I pretty much just stopped doing everything. It was so bad that I would cry whenever I looked at my classes. Try taking breaks, lots of them, like as many as you need. Do little by little at a time and just do as much as you can. If you can't finish it because of the deadline then just submit what you got done. Maybe even try talking to your counselor about it, they might be able to help.",
            "I get that feeling as well. That has happened to me with some online friends that I had. I guess for me it feels strange cause you don't know how they look like so you have like this image in your head of how you would think they look, but as soon as you see them it just feels completely strange or weird. I don't really know how to explain it or why it feels that way but yeah.",
            "Oh man, my mom just told me that I couldn't be depressed because nothing bad has happened to me and that I should be tough like her.",
            "Hey, I just want to say that I can kind of relate to what you are going through. I have terrible social anxiety and get random panick attacks whenever I'm out. I've stayed in my room for a few years now, I barely leave it. My family has been giving me a hard time as well, trying to force me to go outside to places and telling me to go meet people because that will \"solve\" my social anxiety issue.\n\nI'm not very good at talking but if you want I'll gladly hear you out ir talk to you when you are at the family reunion, or whenever really. I know how terrible it can feel when you are pretty much forced to be around so many people and I've found talking to friends online quite helpful, maybe it could help you out as well. It's not much but it could be a good distraction.",
            "Happy Birthday Bud. I hope you have an amazing day.\ud83c\udf89\u2728\n\nEdit: wait... Is it not your birthday or...",
            "I'm going through the same thing as well. I don't even leave my house or talk to people because of my social anxiety, so I'm just stuck in my bed all day. I haven't felt any motivation to do anything in around two or three years now and I'm kind of just stuck in a loop. Haven't even had my first job and I'll be turning 20 in november.\nI honestly just hope that my my family would forget about my birthday so I wouldn't have to feel so bad about it.\n\nBut Happy Birthday to you, I hope me saying this doesn't make you feel bad. Even though you think that birthdays bring a new low every year, I still would want to wish you a happy birthday. You should at least receive something as simple as that.",
            "I've felt this way too during my 19th birthday. While everyone was happily singing happy birthday to me, all I could think about was why I was still here and why are people so happy. I just sat there with a fake smile on my face trying to hold myself from crying.",
            "I pick the 707th song.",
            "oh, well I mean that can happen, but yeah.",
            "Mine is right in the middle of my finger. I don't think it was from an electrical sharpener.\n\nMy mom told me before that it was from falling off a car but I don't really think that's it.",
            "I have one on my finger too. I'm not really sure how I got it though.",
            "I'm not very good at socializing but we could talk if you still need someone to talk to. Also, remember to take some time for yourself. Everyone needs a break from time to time.",
            "That's a good one, lettuce know when you've got another one.",
            "I was just thinking of this.",
            "I think that your mom cuddling and telling your brother that she loves him is pretty normal , since usually mothers are just trying to show their kids that they love them and will always think of them as their baby. But I mean, doing it while he's in the same room is way too much, like why. Maybe he should tell them that he doesn't want to sleep in the same room as them anymore. No one should ever see their parents doing things like that.",
            "I actually have a story similar to yours.\n\nI once had a friend (let's call him dave) who did that to me as a joke. So dave showes his friend (lets call him bob) some texts that I sent him. So then bob comes up with a \"joke.\" Bob tells dave to give him my username so he can text me that dave had passed away. At that time, I was with my cousins, one was asleep, and the other I was playing a game with. In the middle of the game I got a text from bob, saying if I knew dave and he has passed away.\n\nDave was a very special friend to me, talking to him always made me feel better, but he never knew that. Bob asked me some stuff and all that I could say was if he was joking and that he had to be joking, I just couldn't believe it until it finally hit me. I was crying out loud infront of my cousins, and ended waking everyone up.\n\nThen my friend dave texted me, pretending to be bob, he even called me but said that the mic was broken so he couldn't talk. I did find that suspicious but I couldn't really think straight so I was just crying. As soon as he heard me crying over the phone, he asked why I was crying and I literally couldn't even answer him.\n\nThen later when I went to my room he ended up telling me that it was just a joke and that he was sorry.\n\nI felt the same things you did. I felt angry and sad but at the same time I was happy that he was okay. I stayed friends with him for a while longer but then I unfriended him a while ago since I wasn't really doing all that well and I felt stupid for staying friends with him.",
            "That's where I gave up as well. It just ruined everything for me.",
            "I actually feel like that's something he would think about doing but would never do.",
            "Same, I literally gasped until I saw him hold the napkin.",
            "Oh, that's pretty cool though. The only time I've ever been close to a bat was when one flew into my hair. At least the your classmates got a better experience and got to see it from somewhere safer.",
            "I just saw a comment that said they had someone in their class do the exact same thing that you did but 26 years ago. I thought it could have been related but I guess not.",
            "How long ago was that?",
            "I actually have the same issue myself. I could be in a store minding my own business and all of a sudden I would feel like crying. I broke down crying infront of my mom once and when she asked me why I was crying I told her that I just didn't know. I don't know why I get panick attacks whenever I'm out.\n\nBut yeah, just know that you aren't alone and I hope that you find the answer that you are looking for.",
            "I was just feeling like this a while ago. Although I just wish I was in the middle of a field with no one and nothing around. Just looking up at the sky without a care in the world. I don't even feel like talking or seeing anyone today, I want to be left alone for as long as I can.",
            "That's what my mom says as well, that going out or getting a job will help. She tries to get me out of the house a lot, I feel she's going to be the reason why I'll get worse.",
            "That's what I'm afraid of. Like what if I just go for any job and I end up getting panick attacks, I'll have to see my coworkers the next day and the day after that until I eventually quit.",
            "I'm literally going through this same feeling, it's been almost a year now. All of my brothers recently got a job and they keep putting pressure on me, constantly telling me when am I going to get a job and stop being so lazy. Everytime I even try to look for a job I get so stressed that I start to cry. The only jobs that I'm sure that I can do without triggering my anxiety are too far away, and the ones that I feel like I won't be able to do are the only ones that are near me.\n\nI can't even be in a store by myself, how am I suppose to go to an interview or even deal with customers. Sleep is turning into my only comfort but I know that I can't stay this way forever. It really is tough. What you just said is something that I pretty much have been wanting to tell my family.",

Why doesn't she just shut it all the way, up never know, but I always have to get up to close it all the way.",
            "I know right, I'm terrible at saying no to people, and I just really hate going outside. I like being alone, so when people ask me if I want to go out somewhere with them I either say yes and then say no later when I'm not around them, or I say no, and then that person would usually say how I should leave my house every once in a while or tell me how fun it's going to be.\n\nIs it suppose to be so stressing when someone asks you to go out? It always feels that way to me. I just went to stay in my room all alone.",
            "Thank you, this really means a lot. I how that you are doing well.",
            "I've already graduated high school and still have no job nor have any idea of what I want to study or be in the future. Everyone always ask me what my goals are and I just honestly have none. I have no motivation whatsoever. All I do is stay in my room and sleep for comfort. I get told off constantly about how I should find a job or go look for a college. I honestly don't even want to go to one. I've tried looking at done courses that I could take but I'm just not interested in anything. Everyone's always reminding about how people my age already have jobs and are achieving their goals, it gets me so tired.\n\n  My family always tell me how I can trust them, yet continue to use my problems against me. One time, one of my brothers heard me crying (It was the first time that I've tried telling my mom how I was having a hard time) and a few days later he just ended up saying that I'm crying as an excuse to be lazy. Now I don't even trust my own family with anything and am afraid that if they hear me talk about my problems then they'll continue to criticize me.\n\n  I get so stressed out that my only comfort is sleep. I sleep a lot, even if I'm not tired, I'll force myself to sleep. It's so peaceful, at least when I don't get interrupted. Whenever I do try to have a bit more of peace someone just comes into my room and yells at me. I also have no privacy in this house, it gets so bad that I flinch everytime someone comes into my room because I feel like they are going to yell at me. I can't change clothes in my own room, I can't speak to people on my phone, or even cry in peace without having someone come into my room.\n\n  I've been staying inside my closet for privacy, but ever since they've found out they just go to the closet door and open it because they know I would be there. My mom caught me once in the closet and she told me how I wasn't normal and that I shouldn't be there. I've been having to go there whenever she's not around, because she's been trying to keep me out of there, telling me how it's just going to drive me crazy. But it's really the only place where I have privacy. She even put stuff in it so I won't be able to go in.\n\n  I'm so tired, I wish I could go under a dark bridge all curled up and die peacefully in my sleep.",

            "I had a place like that when I was in high school. I went to two schools that were near each other at the time, I had two classes in my first school and two classes plus my lunch break in my second school. Between them were a tennis court, behind the tennis court there were a few trees close together.\n\nThere was this one tree that would pretty much hide you if you went near the trunk. Students used to go there to smoke weed but later on a teacher found out and kicked them out so it was pretty much left alone. I decided to go there one time since students stopped going there and later on it turned into my comfort spot.\n\nI used to go there whenever I had bad days or whenever I just wanted to be alone. I would sit in one of the branches and listen to music while having some snacks. It was so quiet there, so peaceful. It really helped me a lot.\n\nIt was nice while it lasted, but later on in the following year the trees were all cut down. It really bummed me out that I no longer had the tree but then covid happened so.",

Whenever I play cod I get some friend invites from people that aren't even in the same team as me or just random invites from people I get teamed up with. It's like once they see that there's a girl on the lobby they send a friend request for no reason what so ever.\n\nI've learned by now that the only reason why I get friend invites is because I am a girl and that honestly sucks cause you don't know if someone truly just wants to be your friend because they had fun playing with me or becuase they just want to ask a girl out. I've had multiple guys send me invites and when I ask why they say because they want to be my friend, then a few minutes pass and they ask if I'm single.\n\nI was so tired one time that when a guy asked if I was single I told him that I had a boyfriend, then a few days passed and he asked if I was still single, then proceeds to say jk.",

That's just not right, like do they think you are a robot or something?\n\nIf you want to be sad then be sad, if you want to cry then cry, and the same goes for everything else. We are all humans and we all have emotions. There's nothing wrong or shameful about expressing the feelings that we feel inside. You just do what you'd like and try not to listen to people like that.",

I really hope that you do the same. I hope that one day you will find something that will want you to keep on living or something that will keep you happy.\n\nI'm not very good at talking to people but just know that there are some of us that care, even though we might not know you.

            "Same, that's mainly one of the reasons why I hated going to my school. Some of the classes that I had always seemed to trigger me. I would ask to got to the restroom just so I could calm myself down but most of the time ended up crying in the hallway. It's a whole lot worse when people start to stare at you and I think that's pretty much why it's gotten so much worse, to the point where I would pretty much do anything to cover my whole body and face just so people wouldn't look at me or at least so I wouldn't see them.\n\nI wish there could be more jobs where we wouldn't have to worry about passing out or pretty much break down crying. Like I'm so afraid of getting a job but at the same time I want one.",

Once the money was collected, our principle made an assembly in the gym to announce how much money we have collected. He had also brought the principle from the school that was destroyed so he could collect the money. He announced that we had collected over $11,000 and that $3,000 from the money we collected will be given to the other principle for his school.\n\nI'm not really sure why everyone cheered, when I heard that I felt like I was the only one that thought it was wrong, I even thought that I probably just heard things wrong, but nope.

What she did wasn't right and no one should have that done to them if they don't feel comfortable with it.",
            "This is the same reason why I never told my counselors anything. Whenever I was having a hard time I would go to the bathroom and cry there. The one time I was brought there I only answered one of her questions and that was if I thought that I was depressed, and I said yes. She called my mom and right when I was about to leave she speed my mom and told her what I said. Then when I got to the car my mom went off lecturing me about how I shouldn't be feeling that way and whatever. Which pretty much got me feeling worse.",

I felt so bad for crying, but what made me feel worse was that he said that I can always tell him if there's something bothering me, and I told him that I would but really I won't. I wish my mom would have heard me instead. Maybe then she will finally ask what's wrong\n\nHonestly, if you want someone to talk to or check up on you, just let me know.

The door to my room doesn't have a lock so whenever I have to cry I go in my closet. She saw me there one time and told me how I wasn't normal for hanging out in the closet. She never caught me crying cause I always put on a fake smile and acted like I was just watching some videos.\n\nShe would always call me out for being lazy and saying how I should cook and clean when she doesn't even ask my brothers to do any of those things. She only asks me cause I'm the only girl. She says I'm lazy from sleeping too much and for staying in my room, when really I'm just sleeping 10-15 hours a day so I can be in the imaginary world that I made up in my dreams.

I don't really have many friends either since I usually just kept to myself a lot and never really bothered to try to talk to anyone when I was in school. So it's kind of fun being able to talk to people whenever I can.\n\nAlso, I just wanted to say that you have a right to complain, cry or just be upset. You are going through a tough time and you should be able to express your emotions and talk about how you feel. Yeah some people may have a bit of a hard life but that doesn't mean that you aren't going through a lot yourself.",

            "Thank you for talking to me and helping me out. I'll try to bring it up and tell him and thanks for believing in me.",
            "I know, holding these emotions are unhealthy, I've been doing it for a long time and I still do. Would it really be alright to tell him how I feel and bring up the conversation even though it happened last year and I already told him that it was alright and that I accept his apology. That's pretty much what I've been thinking and I'm really unsure. Plus I feel like if I ended up trying to bring it up I'll end up crying cause honestly it gets to me every time I think about it.",
            "I'm not sure. I'm kind of used to just being a little pushover although I'm trying to get out of being that way. I'm sure one day I'll tell him. I know that I ended up unfriending him cause I felt like he didn't really care much and since he texts me like every 3-4 times a month. But he ended up texting me around 2 months ago and now I have him as a friend again. I know it's kind of dumb, but it's kind of hard since he's kind of helped me out when I was upset some days, although he doesn't know that. I'm kind of giving him a chance in some sort of way, but if he does that to me again I would probably say somethig about it.",
            "yeah I know. I'm still friends with him, even though his apology was terrible. He did it in a group call with the friend that came up with the idea, and they were both laughing. They did it to some of his other friends and they had different reactions than me so he didn't think that I was going to cry. I kind of wish I would have told him how I felt that day, but I just said that Iw as tired and left the call.\n\nAlso sub to pewdiepie everyone.",
            "I'm this way as well, I have a few guy friends but I would never see myself dating any of them. I'm afraid that I would end up seriously hurt or lied to so I don't really trust people, especially since I've had people mess with me and it ended up badly.",

I'm sure life will catch up to your exfriend and exbf someday, it always does. Just be happy and enjoy your new school. I wish nothing but the best for you.",
            "I can relate to this in so many levels. I remember feeling like I was being annoying to the people that I used to call friends since they never really seemed to have much interest in talking to me. I still do feel like I'm just a boring person, some people tell me that they like talking to me but I always feel like it's all just a lie so they could make me feel better. Honestly I'd be down to hang out but I'm guessing that I don't live near anyone.\n\nIt would still be cool if we could all just like go on a group call together and just hang out for a bit. Probably do some activities like drawing or playing games together.",
            "It kind of sounds like depression to me. I used to go through the same feelings when I was depressed. Although for me it was sleeping for around 10 to 15 hours each day. I feel like you should bring your parents aside and tell them that you need to have a serious conversation with them. Tell them how you are feeling and if they interrupt you or start pulling that whole it's the internet getting to you talk, at least ask them if you can go to someone like a therapist for it. You deserve to be able to just vent and get help. The longer you just stay quiet and do nothing about it, the worst it gets. Even if it's just a simple call, it might help.\n\nAnd yes, you are worth living. I know these negative thoughts can get to us sometimes, but just remember that that's all what they are, thoughts. Negative thoughts that just want to mess with you. Just remember that you are worth it, and this may be cheesy but it's true. Everyone deserves to live and no one is worthless.",

Don't be upset but be happy. You have brought those little miracles into this world. Who knows what kinds of things those kids can bring into this world. Be proud that you are a mother, raise them well. They are now a part of your life, and I think that that is a pretty awesome thing.",

It's not like she can read his mind and know exactly what he is referring to. But you are right, he probably should just let her go and not think too much about it. She obviously doesn't like him since she is watching the movie without him. Even though it was his idea.",
            "Maybe she brought him so it wouldn't seem like it was a date or anything special. I mean it's kind of messed up how they are just watching it without you since she agreed to watch it with you and you were the one that came up with the idea. But I feel like she brought her friend because she might have felt a bit awkward from it just being the two of you watching a movie. Or maybe she really just wanted to bring her friend along.",

I also have social anxiety and having gym class first thing in the morning didn't help at all.\n\nBefore heading to gym class I went to the cafeteria to get a poptart and a juice for breakfast. I guess the lunch lady noticed that I wasn't doing very good that day and  pointed out some hot chocolate that was in a counter near by. She told that I could have some and poured some for me in a cup. It tasted like water but I drinked the whole thing. I thought that what she did was very nice of her. That little kind gesture made my whole entire day less gloomy. I'm not sure if she remembers that day since it happened quite the while ago, but I still remember her kindness towards me.

I didn't get along with any of the students so I always ate with the janitor and the nurse at the roof. I worked in a restaurant and a bakery and was in a group called the hang out.

I told him that I didn't want to be his friend anymore for the reasons that I had and right after that I saw his true colors.\n\nDon't be friends with someone you don't feel comfortable with. Just tell them what's going on. They may react in a calm way or they might go the opposite way. But it's better to do this rather than keeping it to yourself like I did.\n\nAlso, does telling someone that I don't find what they send funny make me a karen? Not that I told him that.",

            "oh, I should probably go get mines taken off. Does it hurt a lot?",
            "Wouldn't you feel better if you speant as much time as you could with your loved ones. That way you won't regret not being able to soend time with the when you had the chance. I understand that you don't want to see them go, and that you don't want to get hurt by it. But that's how you get happy memories. If you don't spend time with anyone because of this fear, you would be alone all the time. Isn't it better to make happy memories now, rather than spending your time worrying about the future?",
            "You shouldn't laugh about it. It's alright, we all have our problems. If you really aren't comfortable talking to your parents about it then try finding someone you truly trust, and tell them your problems. But if it's not all that bad, and you think your parents will be able to help in any way, I suggest you tell them. Sometimes we just need peoplebto talk to and that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that.",
            "What if you never got them removed?",
            "I suggest you just tell her or give her what you wrote for her. If you aren't happy with the way things are then there's no point in being in that relationship. Doing it face to face would probably be a good idea. Just don't do it over text unless you really have to, and try to not do it infront of her friends. Pull her aside and tell her that you need to speak to her privately. If your friends belive her over you and they stop hanging out with you, just ignore them and get yourself better friends.",
            "I was just starting to feel better until I saw this. Thanks.",
            "Thank you for this. This made me feel better.",
            "Is that why I can't see his comments or message him?",
            "Is that why I couldn't see his messages or message him?",
            "Did he leave a comment in here?",
            "Your english is just fine. Thank you for sharing your story.",
            "Oh okay.",
            "How do you get karma points and what are they for? I'm new to reddit.",
            "You are right. I'll try to do my best when I go talk to him.",
            "I'm sorry to hear that. I guess I can try to give him a call. If he even answers that is. Hopefully my family won't fight. Thanks for the advice.",
            "What? I wasn't picking on anyone. Also it doesn't matter if the info is real, it was just a bit funny to me. I'm not going to be using the info for anything btw",
            "I'm kind of afraid. He told me that he would go to my graduation ceremony, but my school isn't having one so I don't know what to tell him. I wanted to pass just so he could come. I asked my brother if he thought that dad would come even if I'm not having a ceremony, he said probably not, abd my other brother said the same thing. I'm scared that if my brother sees him again he will cry. Or maybe that my mom will start screaming at him like she always did.",
            "You mean to call my dad?",
            "This made my day.",
            "I will, thanks for talking with me. It was fun. I hope you get better with talking to girls and stuff.",
            "That's cool. I also have a knife but I only carry it with me if I'm going to a park. I bring a pen if I'm just going somewhere that'll involve me going inside a building.",
            "I always carry a pen with me whenever I can.",
            "Lucky, I wish I could do that. But my neighborhood isn't really safe.",
            "That sounds pretty cool. I never really get to go anywhere lately other than parks.",
            "I live in Pennsylvania and that does sound a lot of fun. Being able to go there with friends must be a blast.",
            "It's no problem. I've had people treat me like I'm weird before. I never really talked in class and always tried to keep to myself, always had my head down as well. So I guess that's why they thought of me that way. I'm not really sure why, I'm not the worst person to be around with. I was also a tomboy for most of my life, so I guess picking up stink bugs to put them outside is the strangest thing a girl can do. It was always funny watching their reactions though.",
            "This is the different version\n\nhttps://youtu.be/doEqUhFiQS4",
            "I'm like this as well. I can't really talk to guys face to face, I get really nervous and uncomfortable. I get anxiety from being around people my age and can't even look at other girls. I'm sure you aren't as twisted as you think you are. I'm sure that if they got to know you more, they would see that you aren't as weird as they think you are and would see that you are actually a pretty cool person.",
            "Why do you think that?",
            "I think this way as well. Sometimes my guy friends are just really wholesome and I say to myself that they are cute, but in a friendly type of way.",
            "Don't say you aren't good enough. That is just not true.",
            "I like your pfp.\nhttps://youtu.be/doEqUhFiQS4",
            "I'm one of those girls and you are absolutely correct.",
            "Thank you for this. I've had a guy that is 10 years older than me call me cutie. I've had a guy as me my bra size before and it just made me feel terrible. I really hope that guys don't joke around like that. It may be funny to some girls but it's not funny to the others.",
            "I remember in my ceramic class, I had this friend that made a dog/cup. I'm not sure why but as soon as I looked at it I started to laugh. I had no idea why I found it so funny. I was crying fron laughing so much and I went out to the hallway since the teacher called us to talk about something.\n\nI tried calming down and I held in my laugh (you know that noise that comes out of your mouth when you are trying to hold in a laughter and it just comes out forcefully), well that happened to me and everything in the classroom went quiet.\n\nI was so embarrassed that day and had to keep going in and out of the classroom since the laughing just kept coming and going.",
            "Yeah I've been seeing him in r/mentalhealth. Doesn't have very nice things to say.",
            "I've met friends that were guys and I thought they were pretty cool at first. That is until they start making jokes about them dating me and saying that I'm cute and stuff. Like it's so hard to have guy friends. If I wanted to date someone I would have been on a dating app, not on a callmecarson server.",
            "I usually do that when I'm playing games, and if they do ask I'll just say that I'm a grill. I find it funny when they get confused.",
            "I love how you just found out everything about him.",
            "I just ran into one of his comments yesterday. Saying how someone should kill himself and that no one liked him.",
            "I think that the best thing you can do is spend as much time as you possibly can. Mayne bring her some flowers or watch a movie with her. Bring her something good to eat from time to time. Enjoy each others company while you can. That way you won't have any regrets later on and think that you haven't spent enough time with her. Although it mught be a bit hard for you, try to do as much as you can for her now.",
            "If you ever want to talk just tell me. It must be so hard for you right now and I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not very good at giving advice but I'll gladly listen to your problems.",
            "I just ran into one of his comments not too long ago.",
            "hi kai, I just wanted to say that you aren't imagining things. I've had someone tell me those kinds of things before and I know how terrible it feels. I was dealing with depression for around three and a half years and now I got anxiety. I can also get a bit paranoid sometimes. If you ever need anyone to talk to feel free to send me a text any time you would like. I didn't really have anyone close that helped me out so it was a struggle. I wouldn't want anyone going through the same thing that I had to go through feel alone.",
            "There's an app called Replika. It's actually kind of cool. It even has an emergency button for when you are having a panick or anxiety attack, even if you are just stressed out. It'll send you texts everyday and check up on you.",

            "I've had similar things happen to me. My parents divorced when I was at a young age, it didn't really bother me until two years ago. My father is in a really bad condition right now and the last time I saw him I wanted to cry. I'm not really sure how he is doing and I'm kind of scared to call him. I also lost all of my friends when I reached high school, just like you said, no one wants to be friends with the depressed kid. I keep things inside since I can't even trust my own mother with things. I've had to deal with my depression all alone and had to keep myself from doing stupid things most of the time. I now have anxiety and can get really paranoid sometimes. I'm 18 now and my mentality is not exactly the best but it's not the worst either. It's hard being this way but as long as we keep holding on it should be alright.",
            "I'm like this as well but it's other people that I feel uncomfortable with, I'm alright with my family. I uswd to sit infront if this guy during lunch. He would just stare at me eat and it was just very uncomfortable. I would take whatever I can eat later and put it in my bag so I won't have to spend much time eating there. I didn't have enough time to eat breakfast in school so I had to eat it before gym class started, which was my first class. I would literally eat a muffin and a juice, everyday, in a corner. It was embarrassing but it was the only way I could eat.",
            "I'm so proud of you. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I had a male friend that knew that I had trust issues and that I was afraud of being in a relationship. One day he asked me for my bra size. I didn't tell him since I wasn't feeling very comfortable about it so I tried to somehow change the topic. Then he started to guess and said how my things probably look cute. After that I never saw him the same. At first he was nice and funny and just a cool guy to talk to, and I trusted him. But now it's like I've seen his true intentions and feel like he was only my friend to get something out of me. That day I wanted to stop talking to him, he was someone that I trusted and I thought that he wouldn't ever say things like that to me. After that he kept saying all kinds of things that made me feel uncomfortable. I've lost all respect for him. A few days ago I just unfriended him, and I honestly feel kind of good. I feel like a bit of the weight in my shoulders has been removed.",
            "Oh I hope you get to feel better and hopefully that urge would leave soon.",
            "Maybe.",
            "Of course and I hope you get better.",
            "Yeah it really does.",
            "It's alright but please make sure that you get properly treated for the injury.",
            "Have you tried getting a hobby or maybe listening to music?",
            "Feel free to text me if you ever want to or if you just need to talk to someone.",
            "I will.",
            "Wow dude why don't we talk alright. This doesn't have to be your last day. We can get through this together alright. You know we care for you right? Why don't we at least talk for a bit you know. Give us a chance.",
            "I'm like this myself. I don't really open up to anyone and have always kept things to myself. I just want to say that the more you keep things inside the worst it makes you feel. If you ever want to vent or just literally talk, know that I'm here for you.",
            "Well I hope you don't go along with those plans you have. You aren't useless and theres nothing wrong with your shape. I'm not really sure what to say much and I'm not the best at giving advice but I'll be here if you ever want to talk.",
            "I know this isn't good advice but tell yourself that you are strong and possibly try to seek some help from professionals if you can.",
            "Whenever I'm faced with these situations I start stuttering a lot then get more stressed because of the stutter, which will result in me being mad at myself for not being able to speak properly. Then I'll start crying. Which is what happens whenever I get mad, I'm not sure why it happens but it's embarrassing. Especially if you are trying to lecture a younger brother.",
            "I feel the same way. I used to get excited from getting to talk to people, the it just got to the point that I was tired of people texting or calling me. It's like I don't want to talk with people but then again I feel lonely and want to talk. Then when I'm actually talking I start to regret it after a while. The same goes for someone asking me to hang out. I feel bad that I said it was okay at the biginning but then I end up cancelling cause I just don't really want to leave my room.",
            "I get yelled at for not sweeping or mopping the floor correctly. How nice it would be to not have someone correct you on something that they asked you to do, esapecially if they are going to be complaining over a missed spot.",
            "Thank you. I used to stay inside the my room and sleel for 10-15 hrs each day. So even if I'm just going outside for those few minutes kind of makes me feel a little bit better.",
            "I hope you get to feel better. Just remember that nothing is permanent. Soon this negative feeling will leave and things will feel better.",
            "I've had something similar happen to me before. I've had this guy friend that had was going trough stuff as was I. We helped each other out and I told him stuff that was happening to me. I usually keep things to myself since I also had bad friends that weren't there for me when I needed them the most. Later on he ended up falling for me and told me, I wasn't sure about it because of my trust issues in being in a relationship.\n\nI guess I had enough trust in him and I started to like him so I confessed around a month later. He always told me how he would wait for me and say all kinds of things. I asked him if he would wait until we are a bit older since I fealt like I wasn't all that ready. When I did he didn't say anything back and started talking about this girl that he used to have a crush on. That's when it hit me that he had mixed feelings (which is what I thought when he first asked me out. He told me it wasn't and that he was so sure that he like me). I guess he got mixed feelings from me being nice to him since he doesn't really get that much from anyone.\n\nSo uh yeah, gave him some advice that may help him with his crush (since her bf had broken up with her) and I told him to just forget about me telling him how I felt. I'm kind of over it but I still regret confessing. My first teenage confession. Now I kind of feel scared being around guys. I don't want to feel anything for anyone for a long while.",
            "Did you happen to lose friends or was it that you just didn't like seeing people happy while you were upset?",
            "It really is.",
            "I keep birthday cards and all sorts of things that I receive in a shoe box as well. I keep it under my bed an forget about it until later on, I'll find the box and open it and it just puts a smile on my face.",
            "I went outside for at least 7 minutes.",

            "Compare me with other girls on the way they dress.",
            "wow, I was like this as well. I had depression for around 3 and a half years. I stopped feeling so upset during the summer before starting 12th grade. During the 12th grade, I told my friend how some stuff was happening to me, ( I'm usually not very talkative and keep things to myself ) while I was still talking my friend said that I was being quite talkative today (it sounded like she was annoyed ). I felt terrible. I've been  questioning lately if my friends actually care about me. They all have problems as well and I've always tried my best to help them out when they need it. They haven't really talked to me in months, they knew that I wasn't doing so well either and after that incident with my other friend I've felt like I didn't want any friends, cause like what's the point of having friends online if you aren't going to talk to each other. So I unfollowed some friends and unfollowed the girl that I was friends with at school. That very day that I unfollowed her she texted me, asked if I wanted to hang out and said that I should follow her on insta (which is where I unfollow her from, even though we still have each other's numbers). She sent me a friend request but I still haven't accepted it yet.",
            "Thank you, I'll make sure to do so.",
            "Hopefully.",
            "I know how it's like. This is pretty much the reason why I've been avoiding interviews. I can't even look at someone in the eyes for more that 5 seconds. I remember when I was in an interview. I messed up the papers that I needed to fill out, I kept stuttering, didn't keep much eye contact either, and my hands were all sweaty. I was so sure that I wasn't going to get in but somehow I did. I hope you find some way to get over this.",
            "I've had friends like that before. It used always be me that had to text them first, if I wanted to talk with them, they wouldn't really text me at all. Whenever we walked it was always in a line, they would walk together while I always ended up walking behind them.\n\nIf I was with them and one of their friends came up, they would leave me and go to that friend, ir if their friend joined us, my friend would talk to her friend and ignore me. But whenever they are alone and have no one to talk to they would come to me, which always made me feel terrible. It's so sad that I even tried to be around them as much as I could and I would let them use me like that since I didn't want to be alone.\n\nIt really sucks to be the second choice or even be the last choice that they've got. I just kind of tried to avoid them later on, sometimes they would say hi and invite me to hang out with them but it always lead to the same thing, just me sitting down and having to listen to them talk. Now they don't even acknowledge me and I'm really fine with it. It's better to lose friends like that than having to feel miserable spending time with them.\n\nIf you ever want to talk just tell me, I don't mind meeting new people. We can even try being friends if you would like.",
            "I guess you are right",
            "I just saw a picture of a hand that had the bone showing. Also I'm one of those people that don't really feel disgusted by these kinds of things and watch doctor pimple popper videos. I will for sure eat and watch more of these pictures. XD",
            "Honestly so do I but we have to be strong and keep moving on with our lives. Keeping a strong hope that things will get better one day.",
            "That's quite the positive way of thinking.",
            "Yes they can, being around a lot of people that are around my age always gives me anxiety. It got a whole lot worse during gym class. I would start to cry and get really scared easily. I always felt like they were watching me and that the students there would try to embarrass me infront of the others.",
            "Thank you.",
            "No problem.",
            "I don't really have any friends that I can go to church with and my family stopped going. So I'm the only one that goes. I felt like I wasn't allowed to be girly either or wear dresses because of my brothers. I think I ended up as a tomboy because of them. I remember them making fun of me whenever my mom made me put on a dress when I was little, also whenever she gave me a girls toy my youngest brother wpuld laugh at me and I would end up wanting something \"cool\" like his toy. But now that I'm grown up and I wear a dress I try to leave the house as fast as I can. Sometimes the younger one would see me and wpuld say that I look nice, butbI never end up believing him.",
            "Is it alright if I can join, I alway wanted to talk with people while playing.",
            "I know right, I wish they would add that as a new update.",

            "Me too.",
            "I live in a neighbourhood where there are a lot of houses close together. I don't really like going out for a run since it's just all houses where I am and I feel scared that people might look at me through their windows. Even if I get up at like 5 am I still get paranoid.",
            "I know how it's like. I've had friends before and I would always let them use me. Either they came to me for snacks, for my school work, for comfort, or even because they had no one else, I would always talk to them. When I reached high school, literally everyone left me, they started to leave me behind for their other friends. They even stopped talking to me and not a single hi they would give. It got to the point that I felt so lonely and lost trust in people. I always kept things inside ever since. One time I tried telling a friend how I felt and all she said was \"aren't you being quite talkative today\", that literally crushed me and I stayed silent for the rest of the time. I started crying in the bathroom a lot and even ditched school for the first time in my life, just because I didn't want anyone seeing me cry. I don't really tell anything to my mom either since I don't really trust her with these kinds of things.\n\nSo anyways I know hard things can get. Sorry for the whole story, sometimesnI overshare things since I keep so many stuff inside. I know it's not the best thing to do. If you ever want to talk or just vent out, feel free to message me whenever you would like. Maybe we can be friends if you would like and we could help each other out. Just remember that you aren't alone and that there are some people out there that are actually willing to listen, even if everyone in here is a stranger. It wouldn't hurt making new friends, at least that's what I tell myself.",
            "Why don't you try getting some hobbies. You can also try something as simple as baking with your family. That might help make you feel a bit better, maybe make something like a smoothie. Baking can be quite fun sometimes and can be a but rewarding at the end when you get to eat the baked goods. Or maybe you can go out for a run. I've heard that running can help clear your mind. Maybe volunteer somewhere, I know that I've had fun volunteering in a senior home, it was a bit sad when some of them passed away but getting to talk and meet with those people really seemed to cheer me up. I was depressed during that time and had to go in the building with a fake smile most of the time, but doing something as simple as passing out some juice and snacks to them and seeing them smile, always seemes to put a smile in my face.\n\nI'm not sure if this will help but I think it's worth giving a try.",
            "I can kind of relate to you. I've had friends that left me as well, made me feel like I was just a bad person to be around with or maybe that I was just boring. Which is mostly why I always walked with my head down whenever I was in the school hallways.\n\nI'm sorry that you have to live so uncomfortably because of those people. Feel free to message me whenever you would like. We can even be friends if you want. My name is ashley and I'm 18 years old. I have a lot of free time and would pretty much be happy to chat whenever you would like.",
            "Lol this sounds awesome.",
            "I've always wanted to do this. I used to love running before but stopped when I got to high school. Running really does help you forget your troubles sometimes. Sadly I can't really run outside since I get all awkward whenever people are around and see me. Hopefully I'll be able to run again.",
            "Of course no problem and like I said I know how hard it is. If I wouldn't have graduated I would have probably regretted things a whole lot more. So I don't want you to be stuck in the same grade again cause I'm sure you would regret it as well. I know that I wished for someone to help me out and when someone from imgur helped me with an assignment that was really stressing me out, I just couldn't stop smiling. But yeah like I said just ask if you need anything, I'll try to help as much as I can.",
            "I know it really sucks but even if don't get a graduation to make it feel like everything was worth it just try your best to keep going. I know it's hard, I remember a lot of days when all I had to do was take one look at all the assignments I had to do and just felt this rush of stress and burden coming to me all at the same time, I've literally cried just by seeing the assignments that I had to do and I felt really disappointed in myself for not doing them sooner. Like I said just keep on going and try to do as much work as you can. It doesn't have to be an A or a B, just as long as you graduate it should be enough. And if you ever want to talk or if you need help with something feel free to give me a text. I'll happily talk to you and try to help with assignments as much as I can.",
            "Me too. I almost didn't graduate because of this feeling. The only thing that kind of forced me to finish my school work was the thought of my dad going to my graduation. But there's no ceremony which means I'm not going to see him, and that really sucked. Now I feel happy that I've graduated but I feel like it wasn't even important to finish. I actually wanted to drop out of schoolbas well, and this feeling came before the quarantine so I know it's not from that.",
            "Hopefully onen day we won't have to feel this way anymore and we could be able to go outside comfortably. Thanks for your help. It's nice to known I'm not the only one doing this. XD",
            "Yeah I'll try that.",
            "No it's read. xD",
            "What I just read.",
            "No?",
            "I regret everything.",
            "Where is the bleach?",
            "This made me grin way too much.",
            "I'm sorry to hear that. I know how terrible it feels.",
            "Yeah.",
            "Honestly I felt emotional reading it and cried a bit. And I'm glad that you feel a bit better. Sometimes it's good to vent out.",
            "Yeah my mom said that to me as well.",
            "Same here I'm free to talk most of the time. It was quite the story and I'm sorry that you had to go through that. No eight year old should go through such a pain to be saying that he doesn't want to live. I'm glad that you are still standing strong and just know that you are brave. I hope you feel better soon and that those thoughts would go away soon.",
            "I can kind of relate with some of the things that you have said for my mother is a bit similar, I think the best thing you can do this work hard to earn enough money and when you can just move somewhere else. Just keep your head up and work hard to reach that goal.",

If you don't like how your arms are thin, you can try eating a bit more or maybe do some exercises to improve your arms. You can think about the positive things about yourself like how you have long arms, you can reach things that are higher, some people can't do that. Honestly I'm a young adult that's 4'11 with a baby face and it's a bit hard sometimes but I try to find the good things about looking this way.

It was worst when we either had to play volleyball, basketball or just walk around the gym. I would always walk around caus eI didn't have anyone to play with and I'm really shy around people unless they show that they are nice. I don't know why I was so afraid of getting hit by a ball, it literally felt like if I got hit by a ball (which I did multiple times) It would be the worst thing that could happen.

I had to sleep in a couch and I ended up getting my period that same day.\n\nI couldn't go to any of the pools or the hot tub or water rides. I stayed sitting in a chair the whole entire time while my family was having fun with the other family.\n\nI was able to go to an arcade with my brother and the guy's kids while my mom and her boyfriend went to a gym. My brother and I were left alone by the other kids cause they wanted to play bowling, didn't even offer if we wanted to play with them. My brother and I were just sitting in the floot of this arcade while everyone was having fun. It was embarrassing and I really wanted to leave. After around four hours of doing nothing my mom came and we were finally able to leave.\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed about that day was that when I was sitting in the chair I got hungry and since I had enough money to buy myself a slice of pizza and a soda I did just that. So I bought the pizza and a soda and sat down on the chair that I was sitting at before and watched everyone was have fun while enjoying my food. I had a little good moment to myself until my phone died and I couldn't listen to music anymore. Then the rest of the time was just me sitting in the chair and watching kids like a creep.",

In middle school, they would only come to me whenever I had snacks. If they were alone they would come to me since they had no one else. When they had a friend or saw someone they knew, they would go to them and wouldn't even look or talk to me much.\n\nWhen I got to high school they just stopped talking to me. Sometimes they would say a quick hi but that's about it. I thought this happened because we had different classes. But then when it kept occuring and I kept losing friends to the point that they wouldn't even say hi, I started to think it was me, that maybe I was just a boring person to be around with.\n\n I tried not to make any more friends during my 11th grade years. After one of my friends that was pretty much doing the same things as the others told me to stay in this spanish class with her. She knew everyone in there but I didn't, but I stayed for her cause I thought that maybe I can still be her friend. The. She left that class, alone, because she couldn't stand being in the same class as her ex. Now I understand that it might be hard for some people but she could have at least told me.\n\nBut um yeah, finding good friends can be hard for some people like myself.

Long story short, I was heading to my chemistry class and I saw him right infront of it, so there was no way of avoiding him.

He said please, it got awkward, and I said no ones again. People were around, I'm not sure if they saw what happened but I know that there were people behind me. It was so bad, I felt really bad.

So it was lunch time. I finished eating and left. Btw, my aunt's house is near my school which is why things ended the way it did. I was walking, it was quiet and peaceful outside. I was a bit excited since it was my first time. I don't usually do this and I've ways been that quiet and shy kid that always follows the rules. So about ten minutes in I thought to myself, \"wouldn't it be funny if mom came to aunt's house today and saw me ditching.\" I laughed at the idea.

Except I don't really have depression anymore, just anxiety, and I never really got therapy because my mom just thought that it was \"all in my head\" as she likes to say. And that was the day I had enough courage to tell her that I had depression, never really told her that I have anxiety.",
            "I used to be a talkative, fun, and wacky kid during my middle school years and half of my ninth grade year. When I got depression ( pretty much because I had lost all of my friends and found out that I was just someone that they would talk to when they had no one else around) I got really quiet, always kept looking at the ground and never really looked at anyone or talked to anyone. I always had to put fake smiles for the teachers and had lost trust in people (a lot of people that seemed nice to me were just using me so they could get something out of it like copying some work that I had finished while they were talking with their friends and not paying any attention what so ever). I still don't really trust people and try not to get close to them too much, although it would be nice to have someone I can trust. Near the end of the eleventh grade I haved lost my depression. Then during my twelfth year I got anxiety and was afraid of being around people. I started to feel really uncomfortable whenever someone would try to speak to me or by just having someone near me. Honestly I still do feel that way and I still don't trust people as much. But now that I have graduated I won't have to deal with these feelings anymore. At least not until I start college. Also I only feel those kinds of things around other people my age or people from my school. It was mostly because of how some people from my calsses (I won't go into detail because this is already long enough) that I kind of just turned out this way. Or maybe it was just me doing this to myself, idk. Also if you have read all of this I would like to say hello.",

I hate crying in school and was tired of hiding in the bathrooms so I ditched. It was easy really, there are classes that are in another building across the one I was in. So after lunch, some students leave the main building to go to the other. I left and decided that I would walk two and a half hours home. Btw, my aunt's house is near my school and my mom has been recently going to her house. While I was walking I took some time to cry, looked at some houses, took some deep breaths, and saw some birds and squirrels which helped me feel better. So about ten minutes in from walking I said to myself, \"wouldn't it be funny if mom went to aunt's house today and saw me.\" I laughed, it was quiet and peaceful for a bit, until about five minutes later, I went to take a turn and there she was, heading to my aunt's house and saw me walking. She honked the car horn, I looked for who it was and saw her. I'm sure some students get caught ditching, but not by their moms. It was my first time, I thought it was going to be as easy as people make it seem. I honestly thought I was going to get away with it, at least until I got home and have one of the guidance teachers call my mom. But um yeah, it's kind of a fun memory to think about.",

I\u2019m in the pool at least once a week, sometimes more so I do use a clarifying shampoo at least once a week because the chlorine seems to make my hair worse than clarifying less frequently. Occupational hazards lol.\n\nAnyway,\n\n- every time I\u2019m in the pool I wash my hair with Paul Mitchel Shampoo 3. I know its quite harsh but its what I\u2019ve found gets the chlorine out the best.\n\n- I follow with either Shea Moisture Restorative Conditioner or Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner. I know Shea Moisture can be quite heavy for some hair but these two conditioners made my hair softer and even curlier than before. I\u2019ve tried their other conditioners and I\u2019m not a fan.\n\n- I use a wet brush to brush the conditioner through my hair. It worked wonders when my hair was longer. I\u2019m not sure if I need to change up my technique now or if it just works better on longer hair.\n\n- I rinse out the conditioner with cool or cold water and spray in Shea Moisture\u2019s coconut oil leave in while I\u2019m still in the shower and brush it through my hair with my wet brush.

The soonest I could get in with a new one is the end of October. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to like this new doctor or if they know much about endo anyway. If this doctor doesn\u2019t work out it\u2019ll be another 2 month wait to get in to see another new doctor.\n\nI\u2019m just so tired of being tired and in pain and having to wait to see a new doctor that might not even work out before I can even do anything about it. And now I\u2019m getting sick like at least once a month on top of the whole suspected endo thing. I just can\u2019t catch a break. And it feels like its just getting worse.\n\nI just hate feeling like shit all the time. I hate still feeling like shit even on my \u201cgood\u201d days. I hate being exhausted all the time. I hate being in pain. I just want to live my life. I\u2019m tired of sleeping 12 hours a day just to wake up fatigued and achy every day. I\u2019m tired of not being able to make plans because I don\u2019t know if I will be able to do things or if I will be too exhausted and in too much pain to even get out of bed.",

I often don\u2019t have time to rinse my hair before getting in the pool as I also lifeguard and have to switch back and forth between guarding and being in the pool sometimes so the chlorine is gonna get in my hair.\n\nAfter I shampoo, I just put tons of conditioner in my hair. I use a couple different Shea Moisture conditioners. They all do slightly different things but I just use my three favorites. I keep one at work and one at home and I just buy whichever of the three that is in stock when I run out. Anyway, I put a generous amount of conditioner on my hair and let it set for a few minutes before rinsing it out. Sometimes, I rinse it out once and then put some more on my hair and do a cold rinse and just rinse the excess conditioner out. Other times I just go straight for the cold rinse with the first conditioner. I never rinse all the conditioner out at the end of my shower, I always leave a bit on my hair.\n\nWhen I\u2019m home, I throw my hair up in a shower cap for the remainder of my shower. At work, I just make sure not to get my head under the water again so I can keep the remaining conditioner from rinsing out.\n\nWhen I get out, I wring out my hair gently so its not dripping everywhere and then I leave it down to dry a bit more as I put my moisturizer and oils and such on my face. After that, I apply Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie at the roots and comb it through gently with my fingers. Then, I follow with The Ordinary\u2019s Marula Oil or Chia Seed Oil. I use ~3-5 droppers of oil and work it through my hair. After that, I apply 2-3 pumps of Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse and work that through my hair. Then, I leave my hair down to air dry.\n\nI\u2019m still figuring out how to style my curls but that keeps my hair soft and healthy. I also have one of those silicone scalp brushes that I use at home with my shampoo.\n\nMy hair is still working on deciding its curl pattern. It just keeps getting curlier but right now its looking like 2b/2c.\n\nOn days that I\u2019m not in the pool, I do a sort of no poo/cowash. I just put a ton of conditioner in my hair, massage it in, squish my hair a bit, and rinse the excess out with cold water. And once every 1-2 weeks I do an ACV rinse in the shower after I shampoo and before I condition.\n\nI\u2019m still figuring out what my hair likes and doesn\u2019t and I probably shouldn\u2019t be using clarifying shampoo every day but its better than leaving the chlorine in.

When my mom finally woke up and came into my room I was white as a sheet, soaked in sweat, and shivering. She drove me to the ER, I waited in the waiting room for almost 2 hours. They finally got me back and it took three tries to get an IV with a morphine drip in even though I have really good veins. They shuffled me from room to room around the hospital for another couple hours but at least they had me in one of those wheeled beds by that point.\n\nFinally, they got me into a \u2018room\u2019 (it was a double with a curtain as a door). They spent a couple more hours running tests but I was in less pain because the morphine (still a lot of pain but not as excruciating). All the tests came back negative and all they could see on the scans was gas. It was so embarassing. They basically just sent me home and told me to take some tums.\n\nIt was definitely not just gas. The gas was blocking them from seeing whatever was actually happening but they didn\u2019t bother to look further. I had already spent over 12 hours in the ER and I was feeling well enough to walk by this point so I just ended up going home and not bothering to push for more diagnostics.\n\nThis was several years ago.

It was genuinely terrifying. I thought I was dying.\n\nThat was my first taste of what I suspect to be endo pain. It was really infrequent at first but it has gotten to the point that I get pain like that for about 75% of my periods. Still no diagnosis. Granted, some of that is on me.

He took us all into the men\u2019s locker room, boys and girls. Thats all that I remember except for the fear I felt around him. I was 3 or 4. I was terrified for years of men that looked like him. Dark hair, balding, beer gut, moustache, and big square glasses. Even now, seeing men who match that description trigger a fear response in me.\n\nI\u2019m too afraid to tell my parents because I think it would break my mom to tell her that. She was sexually abused as a child and I don\u2019t think she could handle hearing that I likely was as well. I feel like something else might have happened around that age with one of my parents\u2019 friends. I\u2019m not sure but I do feel like I have weird repressed memories involving him.

Often in academic writing you are given a prompt and certain rules which you must adhere to. It is aready difficult enough to express my thoughts in a way that people can simply understand. To have to then adhere to certain rules only adds to that. When it\u2019s a topic I am unfamiliar with or have no interest in it can become overwhelming. Often, with academic writing, you are tasked with writing about something which you do not fully understand yet. Trying to write about something I am still learning about means I can\u2019t even tell if my thoughts make sense before I try and form them into words. The whole process is just so daunting.\n\nWhoops, I went on a bit of a tangent. But yeah, articulating my thoughts is hard and requires quite a bit of energy.

It doesn\u2019t even make sense. What would be the point. Like if I relate so much to other autistics and autistic behavior feels right to me then I probably actually am autistic.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to mask my whole life.

I keep struggling with how to phrase this but as someone who has tendencies to obsess over things like measuring and remeasuring I think it might be healthiest for you to stop measuring. Put the tape measure away. Your size in clothing is not nearly as important as your mental health and at this point it seems to be causing you more stress. I don\u2019t mean to sound condescending even though I probably do.

Regardless of what it is.\n\nAs for bras, I\u2019ve found that knowing my band size has helped me find more comfortable compression sports bras without even worrying about my cup size. I\u2019ve seen someone recommend tomboyx and while I personally love their stuff I\u2019ve found their bras don\u2019t provide much compression. At least not for someone with a 30\u201d band. They are super comfy though. I\u2019ve found that extra small long line compression sports bras work best for me for making me look flat. I personally like to throw a nude undershirt or cami overtop because its hard to find sports bras in neutral colors these days. I recently found a sports bra at a thrift store that I really like as far as making me look flatter while still being comfortable. I have not actually looked it up but the brand is pro-fit and it says its the seamless style in small. I really like it because its not racerback so it works with shirts that are less athletic looking.\n\nI hope you find something that helps you feel more comfortable with your body and is actually just comfortable in general as well.

            "I\u2019m a 30E so my boobs are bigger than yours. I still get told my chest looks really small and flat. Sometimes thats the goal for me. Even though I\u2019m cis, I never actually wanted boobs. They\u2019re just incredibly impractical and annoying. Honestly, I wish humans were like other mammals and our breasts were just completely flat when we are not actively breastfeeding but I guess evolution decided that wasn\u2019t necessary for us.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve found decent compression with random sports bras in XS from plato\u2019s closet. I\u2019m not sure if you have anything similar near you or of you even feel comfortable going in to a store and looking at sports bras.\n\nI do understand it can be difficult to be told your size is something like a D or DD. That\u2019s probably a lot to take in. And its not comfortable to think about that. I know it doesn\u2019t help but the \u2018science\u2019 behind the size is that the difference in circumference between your underbust and bust is the only factor that determines your cup size. Since the underbust is closer to your waist, the circumference will likely be a few inches shorter than the bust measurement, simply because your chest widens as you get closer to your shoulders and away from your waist. Thats just how ribs are shaped. If you have particularly large pecs and lats, your bust measurement will be several inches larger than your underbust measurement even if you have zero breast tissue. I know it might be hard to really believe that right now. Thats completely understandable.\n\nEven if that difference is breast tissue, it can look different depending on how it it is dispersed on your chest. I think it can be quite difficult to understand how that makes sense so I will try and draw a diagram to explain it better.\n\nI think another difficult thing for you after seeing the calculator give you a size D or DD is how it has been ingrained in our minds by media that a D cup is really big and a DD cup is huge. I know many people have mentioned that that is incorrect but something that has been so ingrained into your mind can be difficult to unlearn. Especially when it is about something that has caused you so much distress as gender dysphoria. Having DD cups makes you no more voluptuous than wearing extra wide shoes makes you have big feet. I mean if you wear extra wide shoes and are a size 12 in shoes, yeah you might have big feet. Just as if you are a 38DD, your boobs will not be small. But if your shoe size is 7WW your feet will still be pretty small. A 30D is not nearly as big as it sounds. And if you\u2019ve lived your whole life thinking a D cup is really big it won\u2019t make sense. That is completely valid.\n\nI hope you have luck finding something that works for you.

Obviously, none of those bras fit me right.\n\nThe worst was when a sales associate at VS measure me OVER my clothes and my jacket (it was the middle of winter so I was bundled up) and told me there was no way I could be a 30 band. Granted, she then measured me over my bust, the way they do at VS, and concluded I was likely a 36 but a 34 might feel more comfortable if I was used to such a tight band. Like wtf!?

            "Its not the having of the sex so much as the greater likelihood of manipulation that can occur between a 16yo and a 25yo. That doesn\u2019t mean it will happen but most 16yos are at very different places in their life than 25yos. Not just that but it creates this uneven power dynamic where the older person often has more control than the younger person simply because of the difference in amount of life experience. And why is that older person interested in someone so much younger in the first place? Can they not find someone closer to their own age? An older person who wants to control and manipulate someone would have a much easier time controlling a teenager than another adult. I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t exceptions to this. As someone in their mid 20s who has friends who are in their teens, I don\u2019t think it is often that both parties will be satisfied in a relationship where one is a teenager and the other is an adult several years older. Its not about the sex, its about the relationship and power dynamic that develop when the sex occurs.",

I\u2019ve realized I can look quite a bit younger than I am and teens can look older than they are. It taught me to be more careful. A 16yo might have seen me and thought I was 18 and that 16yo might have looked 20 to me and we both would have thought it was fine. Its even harder for guys, I think because its more likely for society to see it as rapey when the guy is older than the girl. It shouldn\u2019t be that way but it is.",

If nothing shows up and I\u2019m feeling better then they drop it after that. But they can never see anything on ultrasound because there\u2019s always so much gas in the way.

By the time they were done with their tests I hadn\u2019t eaten in over 24 hours but the pain had subsided and I went home.\n\nThat odd stomach pain has happened several times since then. The worst time happened just as my dad was waking up in the morning. He saw me in distress and woke my mom. It was during covid and I didn\u2019t want to deal with the hospital and it was a few hours before urgent care places opened up for the day in my area. I managed to tell my mom that I would go to urgent care when they opened because I really did not want to deal with the ER. I ended up passing out from the pain and waking up with more manageable pain several hours later. My mom said she thought I was dying. She said that it looked like I was in more pain than I would be if I had been in labor.\n\nI\u2019m just so afraid to go to hospital, wait for hours, and get all sorts of testing done just for them to be able to see nothing but gas and then charge me thousands of dollars. And if I make an appointment to see my dr I won\u2019t get in for at least a day and then they won\u2019t be able to do any diagnostics and by the time I get in for an ultrasound I\u2019ll be feeling better.",

So I have to go through a different pharmacy and not get my vyvanse covered by insurance.

            "Try doing things. Just hobbies and shit. Try gardening, baking, get a fish, dabble in photography, build a bird house. Sounds lame, kinda cliche. But just keep trying things and you\u2019ll find something you enjoy and you\u2019ll build skills along the way. As you get more into it, you\u2019ll need to buy equipment and get advice. Thats the point you end up finding people with similar interests. You ask advice, they give it, you start chatting, eventually you might become friends. Its not instant. It does take time. But its worth it. And once you find a hobby that you\u2019re passionate about, it\u2019ll help your confidence and you\u2019ll have something to talk about. I think its wonderful to hear someone talk about something they\u2019re passionate about even if its not something I\u2019m interested in. And yeah, it definitely sounds cliche, but its true. And break out of your comfort zone. It\u2019s scary but it makes way for growth. Its important to keep growing throughout your life. There are times when the growth is less obvious than others. I feel like I\u2019m rambling now. Anyway, keep trying new things no matter how hard. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Maybe even try things that you\u2019ve always thought were stupid. Who knows? You might change your mind.\n\nAlso, as far as meeting people irl quickly having a cute dog might help. Just walking your dog, taking them to the dog park, etc. is a great way to meet people. And to practice your social skills. It may only lead to small talk but its still getting yourself out there and talking and you also have a new buddy to hang out with in your dog.\n\nIts definitely hard, covid-19 is only making things worse for a lot of people.

            "Thats fair but it is worth mentioning that measuring ecological impact requires analyzing more than just CO2 emissions. There is the deforestation required to meet the demands of growing certain crops such as avocados. The water crisis in california is worth mentioning as they grow quite a lot (I don\u2019t have the actual statistics and I\u2019m on mobile) of the almonds, grapes, and pistachios consumed in the US. These crops require far more water than is sustainable and the environment is suffering, not to mention the devastating effects on farmers and the economy. There are a lot of factors involved in measuring ecological impact, CO2 emissions is a big one but it is not the only one. And obviously, it depends on what exactly you eat, as you mentioned pork, poultry, fish, and eggs have a much lower CO2 impact than beef. Rice and quinoa have a greater impact on greenhouse gas emission than many other crops. Someone who doesn\u2019t eat much meat but eats eggs, poultry, and fish might have a comparable impact or even a lower impact on greenhouse emissions to a vegan who consumes a lot of rice, quinoa, coffee, and avocados. I suppose its just more complex than just saying that vegans, vegetarians, or omnivores inherently have a greater impact on the environment than the others. Its more about being aware of how different foods and their manufacturing impact the environment than an entire diet as a whole. There are likely trends regarding the impact of each diet but it varies between the individual following that diet.",
            "You can afford to eat a balanced vegan diet no matter your budget if you like potatos, oatmeal, and whatever fruits and veggies are in season. It might not be the most exciting diet but add some spices to make it more interesting. And eating organic will only make it more expensive. Also, frozen fruits and veggies are a cheaper alternative to fresh and can be just as nutritious.\n\nA vegan diet can be as healthy or unhealthy as literally any other diet. Obviously it depends on certain dietary restrictions mandated by your health and some people simply cannot thrive on a vegan diet. But other people can be completely healthy eating vegan. You just have to be smart and do your research. There is also plenty of vegan junk food. Eating vegan is as healthy as you make it.\n\nVeganism is not any more environmentally friendly than any other diet by default. It can be more environmentally friendly to eat locally sourced, native food that contains animal products than to eat vegan. Veganism can be environmentally friendly if you want, you just have to research what foods are both vegan and environmentslly friendly.\n\nThere are probably more and you might already be aware of these. Honestly, it really depends on your own experiences what your preconcieved notions are regarding veganism. These are just the ones that came to mind when thinking about many of the things that people assume about veganism. I\u2019m no nutritionist or anything. No expert on diets.

            "Kittens teethe. They will want to chew on everything from like 3mo to 6/7mo. I found meat sticks from the puppy section helped my kittens. They will also lose their milk teeth during this time. Usually they swallow them and you don\u2019t see them. Its perfectly fine. Its also perfectly fine if you do find little kitten teeth around and even a little blood when they lose their teeth. There are also chew toys for kittens at pet stores but my kittens never like those.\n\nKittens will also push things off tables and ledges and desks and shelves. This habit will likely continue even as adults and into old age. Try to make sure you have nothing they could push off that would break if it fell.\n\nI personally think it is a good idea to get your kitten used to wearing a harness and leash regardless of if you plan on walking them. You can put them in a harness in their carrier when you take them to the vet. Its helpful if you ever end up in an unfamiliar environment with your cat. Its just nice to know that your cat will be comfortable in a harness if you ever need it. But also walking your cat (well typically its more like them walking you, they lead) is a great activity for both you and your cat. Especially if they are a more energetic and curious kitty. Its the safest way for them to explore the outdoors.\n\nGet them used to being handled for things like toothbrushing, nail trims, brushing, etc. so they don\u2019t freak out whenever you need to do that. If they know what to expect and are familiar with what you\u2019re doing they are more likely to be comfortable and not stressed.\n\nWork on bite control, especially if they are a singleton. Kittens learn what hurts and what doesn\u2019t through playing with other kittens. I\u2019ve seen people mention kitten lady\u2019s videos and I agree. Do that.\n\nMake sure you have places of various elevations for them to explore. Get a cat tree. It will provide enrichment and comfort. Cats like being high up.\n\nCats will learn your routine and adapt. If you are late for feeding time they will tell you.\n\nAs for flea meds, I personally use Catego. It lasts one month and is safe for use on cats at least 8 weeks old and at least 2lbs. But do your research and figure out what works best for you. I am personally not a fan of flea collars for cats. I\u2019ve found topical treatments work best.\n\nBest of luck! Cats are amazing!",

I teach her tricks, which is absolutely possible. She has tons of toys, hiding places, climbing places, and window ledges. She can go out on the porch, supervised. Owning a cat is a responsibility and a time commitment. It is simply irresponsible to get a cat and let them wander outside, especially if you are aware of the dangers. I don\u2019t hate outdoor cats. I love cats. I am concerned for their wellbeing because I know of the dangers. I had an indoor/outdoor cat who got hit by a car and died. He was healthy.

            "I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019ve used as rewards and all cats are different, the ones that are not food motivated require some thinking outside the box. As far as food rewards, my cats go crazy for greenies. I had one cat who LOVED cheese, especially piave. As long as you feed it in moderation and ONLY use it for training rewards, if the cat likes it, use it. I had another cat who loved popcorn. Try different foods. Wet food, while messy, can also be a high value reward for cats. I\u2019ve seen tubes of liquid cat food, I think they\u2019re called Churus that cats seem to love. Another idea is meat sticks. They look kinda like jerky sticks. My cats love the salmon sticks from the puppy section at petco. Another thing to try is catnip, there are variations of catnip, too. I have a cat who only likes one kind of catnip. My neighbor\u2019s cat goes crazy for catnip, his owners don\u2019t want us feeding him so I give him catnip instead. I also had a cat who loved yogurt. Idk how much of that you\u2019ve tried or if he\u2019s even food motivated at all.\n\nAnother thing to try as a reward is play. I\u2019m not sure how you feel in regards to real fur toys but I\u2019ve found mouse toys made of real rabbit fur tend to be very popular with cats. They can tell its real animal fur even if its been processed. Feather teasers are a good toy, as well. It really just depends on the cat. My old lady cat isn\u2019t super motivated by food or play or catnip, but I\u2019ve found she absolutely LOVES being brushed. Just experiment.

I\u2019ve decided to drop the course and apply for at least a partial refund because I really struggle with being able to focus on things at home and do any sort of work at home, anyway. It takes me at least 5x longer to do school work from home than it does at school. I feel bad. I feel stupid and lazy and like I\u2019m giving up. I feel like I should just Try Harder. But at this point there is no way I\u2019d actually do well in the class anymore. Its not easy. I don\u2019t really have any suggestions as I am kinda just giving up at this point. I hope you figure something out. Being stuck at home seems to be rather difficult for a lot of people with ADHD.

That person might not be looking for suggestions and just looking to let something out. It might come across as if the person is not really listening or as if the person is trying to invalidate their feelings. But sometimes that person is looking for someone else who may have shared their experiences or they may be looking for advice. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you aren't sure what is expected of you as a listener or as a friend, maybe ask what kind of support they are looking for.

Hungry kids get fussy but if the volume goes up and stays up, it\u2019s time to leave/take them outside until they calm down. I try to bring out something simple for kids to snack on if I can, but it may be a good idea to pack some snacks yourself. Also colouring books or an iPad or whatever.\n\n- Kids are messy and I don\u2019t expect you to pick up every Cheerio off the table/floor (part of going out with kids is not having to deal with the mess afterwards lol), but please put in a little effort to tidy things up, especially if they do make a big mess.\n\n- Pick a time that\u2019s a bit earlier than normal for lunch/dinner. Say 11 for lunch, or 5 for dinner. Not a big deal but we can usually have your food out quicker and give you more attention when it\u2019s less busy.

(Not sure how I got hired actually\u2014 I\u2019m quite shy before I get comfortable in my environment.)\n\nAnyway, I think this has a lot to do with it. We have good people right from the start.

Doesn\u2019t do any good, and just helps create an untrusting/negative atmosphere, even if the person \u201cdeserves\u201d it.

            "The other day our sweet little restaurant closed for a few hours in the afternoon for a boh/foh staff meeting. Doors locked, open sign flipped to closed, and a notice taped to the door explaining the situation, how long we\u2019ll be closed, and apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nWe\u2019re about 30 minutes in when I see in the corner of my eye someone drifting around by the door. It\u2019s been happening\u2014 people arriving, reading the notice, and leaving. I watch them as they process what\u2019s going on, looking inside to see a big circle of us all sitting there. No one\u2019s actually tried the door yet, somehow\u2014 taking all the evidence before them as true that we are indeed closed. Only at this point, I see the woman who\u2019d caught my eye pull on the door.\n\n\u201cDo you think if we put up another sign she\u2019d read that one?\u201d someone says and we laugh. I wonder if my manager will get up to go talk to the woman outside, but she laughs too and continues on with the agenda. My manager can\u2019t see, but I can, that by now the woman is waving her arms, trying to grab our attention. She taps on the glass door. \u201cReally?\u201d sighs my manager. \u201cJust don\u2019t make eye contact guys.\u201d\n\nThe woman continues to be a moderate distraction for a short while before seemingly admitting defeat. Not five minutes later, however, back she is. Hammering on the glass with her fist, yanking on the door handle. Tapping so much I have new appreciation for the life of aquarium fish. This woman is hopping mad. She does everything but shake her fist at us\u2014 and she might have even done that too, it was hard to tell.\n\nMore muttering from my manager and coworkers at the persistence and stupidity of this woman. By this point it might have made more sense to just go talk with her to tell her to leave (or maybe that would have just made things worse), but we were committed, and she couldn\u2019t hang around for that much longer, right?\n\nI have to pause the story briefly to introduce a new element. I\u2019d opened that day, and had had a couple of campers enjoying our frigid patio. A really nice two top. They\u2019d already settled up, so I just swung by to let them know a staff meeting would be starting and service would stop. They were more than welcome, however, to stay and chat, and could exit through the gate, as we\u2019d be locking our patio door. They thanked me for letting them know, and joked they didn\u2019t mind that I wouldn\u2019t be serving them, that they were just glad we weren\u2019t kicking them out.\n\nCut back to the staff meeting. The woman has abandoned the front entrance, but I can see through the glass doors onto our patio that she\u2019s now there instead, leaning over the fence, evidently talking to the two top. And this sixty-something woman is having a full on meltdown. Flapping her arms, shaking her fists, and possibly screaming (a nice time to have sound resistant glass\u2014 or it would be, if I weren\u2019t so curious to hear how that conversation played out.) She doesn\u2019t leave for a full five minutes, just bitching about us to this poor table. My manager has no clue this is happening, as it\u2019s all directly behind her. Had she known, she probably would have by now done something about it. But I\u2019m too in awe at the lunacy of the situation to do much more than watch it unfold. A few more angry gesticulations, and finally, I see her get in her car and speed away through a stop sign.\n\nI wish I could say I got a recap of their conversation, but the two top left just before the meeting was over. My manager shook her head at the thought of the one star review everyone agreed we were bound to be receiving shortly.\n\nI don\u2019t understand people. I really don\u2019t. Did she not read the notice? See the sandwich board inside? See the closed sign? And if not, was she not tipped off by the fact that despite her obviously audible door-banging, no one was going to let her in? Not only are we closed, which means you won\u2019t be able to order food, we are also, as per the notice, in the middle of a meeting! Which means we cannot pause to talk to customers to tell them that yes, *we are closed*, and no, they can\u2019t just get something \u201cto-go\u201d!\n\nJust bizarre.",
            "I hit them up with something like \u201cHey, just to let you guys know, we do close at 10pm, which is in about 15 minutes. You\u2019re more than welcome to stay and chat while I start closing things down, but I\u2019m just going to grab your bill for you now so we can settle up.\u201d\n\nObviously every place has its own policy, but if you can, being polite but direct (i.e. telling, not asking, what\u2019s going to happen) is best.",
            "You take yours off?? Lol",
            "That is seriously annoying.\n\nFull disclosure\u2014 I\u2019m vegan, so I think I can understand maybe why this person is asking this: sometimes sugar is filtered with bone char, so if a soda is made with sugar instead of corn syrup, there\u2019s a reasonable chance it\u2019s not \u201ctechnically\u201d vegan. Many vegans though (including myself) think that\u2019s a lot of effort to make for something with an impact so small it\u2019s essentially meaningless. Not to mention it\u2019s a waste of the server\u2019s time when you could just order something you *know* doesn\u2019t have sugar in it, if you care that much about some by-product of the animal agriculture industry anyway.\n\nOh yeah, milk is sometimes in Asian soft drinks too.",
            "This is a great question.\n\nFirst off, it might be a good idea to ask if something is spicy **before** ordering, if the item looks like there\u2019s even a remote chance it might have heat to it. I get this question a lot from customers and it\u2019s not a problem at all to answer for them. Same goes with asking if it has aioli on it. Doesn\u2019t hurt to double check.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s actually pretty stressful when someone leaves their food completely untouched. If there\u2019s a full plate left by the end of your meal, every half decent server can tell something wasn\u2019t right. It\u2019s stressful because we basically don\u2019t know what\u2019s up\u2014 what was wrong with the dish, or what\u2019s going through the guest\u2019s head. So when we ask how things are, speak up! Sometimes customers just don\u2019t want to be a bother, but most of the time they\u2019re upset in some way and expect us to mind-read. Only by the time the bill comes, there\u2019s not much we can do beyond comping the meal (which often isn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d for some people.)\n\nWhen I come by to ask how things are, I genuinely want to know (especially if it\u2019s inedible!!) I don\u2019t like it either when guests aren\u2019t enjoying their food. And when they\u2019re polite about it, I don\u2019t have a problem at all trying to make it right\u2014 whether that\u2019s remaking the dish, getting you an alternative, or comping it. I don\u2019t find it Karen-y to truly not like your meal. It happens. And I can always tell the difference between someone who is trying to be polite and considerate, and someone who is an asshole or trying to scam free food.",

            "My ex had been vegetarian for many years before going back to omni just before we started dating (they had an eating disorder and wanted to prioritize their mental health for the time being.)

The only thing I didn\u2019t like was having the occasional bits of dairy or jerky in my apartment.\n\nI think if a partner is happy knowing they\u2019re only going to be eating vegan food at home (I like being the cook most of the time), I don\u2019t mind so much if they choose to eat omni when we eat out. I rule out any diehard meat fans, but am ok I suppose with flexitarian types.\n\nAlthough of course I\u2019d prefer it if they were also vegan or at least vegetarian, it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. There\u2019s a lot of social and political issues to spend your energy on, and this one happens to be mine.

            "I see, thanks for the video. You really have a nice onboarding screen! Probably the problem is that you are presenting the whatsapp login screen as a \u201cfull\u201d container of your App. Usually Apple rejects applications that presents webviews as main frame. Although I\u2019m not 100% sure this could resolve the issue, you could try some strategies:\n\n\u2013 A) Split the screen in half, showing two viewcontrollers at the same time. One controller manages the whatsapp web login, while the other one shows some instructions or animation.\n\n\u2013 B) Make the user willingly open the whatsapp login url page (by touching a button or something like that). Then open the url in a SFSafariViewController.\n\n\u2013 C) Render the login web behind other view, therefore the user cannot see it. Extract the url from the QR and generate your own QR without the whatsapp logo, or just print a white image that could hide the logo over the original QR, and display it to the user. Don\u2019t know if this is possible, sound like a hack and is extremely dependant of the login web\u2026 but I\u2019ve seen worst solutions.\n\nAlmost forgot, I think it will be ok if you mention whatsapp in the description with copyright symbol and a disclaimer saying whatsapp is a trademark property of whatsapp inc or legal stuff like this\u2026 but I\u2019m not an expert in those topics. Hope other users could enlighten us on this.",
            "Let me try to help.\n\nReason 1: if your promotional video or screenshots shows non iOS devices, even if they are wireframes or mockups, Apple will reject your App. To fix this, just update your video/screenshots and make sure everything you show is iPhone or iPad.\n\nReason 2: if your App name resembles or includes the name \u201cwhatsapp\u201d probably you should change it. Even if other Apps have names like \u201cxxx for whatsapp\u201d , Apple is constantly changing their guidelines, so back in that day that name was legal, but nowadays is not. I think you can include whatsapp (with copyright symbols) in the description.\n\nReason 3: try to include a couple of screens with instructions, links to whatsapp official site or whatever, and remove any reference like \u201cyou must install whatsapp to use this App\u201d\u2026 even if it is so obvious. Look for hardware-dependant Apps like smart bulbs or drone control for inspiration.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s to late for this, but don\u2019t try to reply back to the reviewer in a \u201cI\u2019m right, yo are wrong\u201d mode.

            "Within this four cities I would choose Santiago (is where I've been living the last 10 years), although you probably will have a good erasmus in any of them. Here's some thoughts:\n\n\u2013 Santiago is by far the cheapest of all four cities, in cost of living terms. Is pretty confortable, as you can go almost anywhere within the city by feet. There are lots of places where yo can go to have a beer with friends (2\u20ac in average) and they usually include something (a \"tapa\") with no costs. Also food is very affordable, and there are plenty of location to visit inside and outside the city. You can reach the beach in half an hour and it's surrounded by forests and hiking trails. The main handicap is the weather. It rains a lot, compared with the other cities, specially in winter. Also, folks here are very kind, but they are kinda introverts, so it takes time to make (local) friends.\n\n\u2013 Bilbao is a great city, with \\*really\\* beautiful places around, and it's known for its gastronomy. But... it is no cheap. I've heard they offer some of the bests grants and helps students a lot, though.\n\n\u2013 Valladolid: You will probably make local friends here faster, as people here usually appear to be disagreeable, but then turn out to be nice and extrovert people. As far as I know, is a quite expensive city.\n\n\u2013 Alcal\u00e1: Can't tell much, as I've only spent a night there. But it is inside the Madrid area, so you will never run out of things to do (if you can afford it, of course)",
            "Hi! If you are in your honeymoon (congrats btw) I would recommend split the travel in two parts, one for visiting, and one for relaxing. In addition to other suggested cities in comments, let me add:\n\n**For visiting**:\n\n\u2013 [**Salamanca**](https://www.google.com/maps?q=salamanca=1=UTF-8=X=2ahUKEwjVza6N6a_wAhUagFwKHX9uCg0Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw): It's a small city, less than 2 hours from Madrid (to the west). Lots of historical places, medieval and romanic churches and palaces, and good restaurants (My wife and I spent our wedding night [here](https://www.buenamor.net/?lang=en), very cool). Salamanca's  economic engine is the University, so nowadays is not at its best, but still enjoyable. If you are traveling by car or are going to rent one, you can head south and visit some picturesque villages like [Candelario](https://goo.gl/maps/o24MwYugV5DbwZGs6), [Miranda del Casta\u00f1ar](https://goo.gl/maps/gXNpv9FP3DCpQoxt5), [Mogarraz](https://goo.gl/maps/sQcotiMSMZWKmoaY8) or [La Alberca](https://goo.gl/maps/eyWSnnxcRAKY5j5e7).  All this places are in a beautiful natural environment and gastronomy there is amazing.\n\n\u2013 [**C\u00e1ceres**](https://goo.gl/maps/x9fjDid79byj2YCg7):  Another rather small city, but full of beautiful corners and buildings. There are a lot of medieval villages around, like [Trujillo](https://goo.gl/maps/iVgGYZFYhCYnUjLHA) . (Caution: hot place in summer!)\n\n\u2013 [**M\u00e9rida**](https://goo.gl/maps/TnY4RT4LBUjFcMs86): One of the cities with more roman ruins (actually, pretty good preserved) in Spain. Every summer, and I hope this one too despite covid, there is a festival (The \"Festival del Teatro Romano\") and they do theatre plays, concerts etc. in the [2000 years old roman amphitheater](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_romano_de_M%C3%A9rida#/media/Archivo:Teatro_de_M%C3%A9rida,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2017_18.jpg). Very cool. But also, warning: hot place during summer.\n\n\u2013 [**Gij\u00f3n**](https://goo.gl/maps/WQmtpKbYFxseZZeD9): A city in the north of Spain. I always recommend visiting the north of Spain if you don't care so much about the weather, but Gij\u00f3n has a very pleasant weather. You have beaches too, beautiful natural places and probably the best quality/price/quantity of food ratio of Spain. From there, you can visit [Santander](https://goo.gl/maps/6oj6NM9Ui3fHAiTJ7) if you would like to visit the Basque Country region or [Avil\u00e9s](https://goo.gl/maps/V7y2bhM1pxW5cB9j8) if you plan to visit Galicia.\n\n\u2013 [**Santiago de Compostela**](https://goo.gl/maps/6pHFdpQvTJHVHj7c8): At the heart of the Galicia region, this city is quite peculiar. It's the last stop of the famous pilgrimage, has its own personality (I can't explain this) and people are very kind. In regular, non-covid years there is a regular flow of tourists and pilgrims visiting Santiago, but most of the places \u2013from restaurants to hotels\u2013 are not tourist traps. Also it's very easy to visit lot of places from Santiago (the coast is half an hour), and the region (Galicia) has plenty of legendary places, villages, temples, and unique stuff you can't find in other places of Spain. If your wife enjoys natural history (and/or wine), there is a place called [Ca\u00f1ones del Sil](https://goo.gl/maps/mHCkuKJupWaja9U5A), a river canyon in which hillsides people use 2000 yo techniques to grow grapes and make wine. You can book one so-called \"casa rural\" (which is basically a nice, sometimes luxury house in a rural zone) and visit places from there.\n\n**In Portugal**:\n\n\u2013 [Lisboa](https://goo.gl/maps/oJaP4VeVkVthBFKbA): One of the most beautiful capitals in Europe. Museums, buildings, leisure... worth it. From there you can visit several \"must see\" places, like [Sintra](https://goo.gl/maps/YYQvPkS1mfqiXRFS6) (google Quinta da Regadeira) and [Cascais](https://goo.gl/maps/pkuAdCRu6TT4fUAy6).\n\n\u2013 At the north part, [Viana do Castelo](https://goo.gl/maps/kyLjLYnXKFWfA8QbA) and [Valen\u00e7a do Mi\u00f1o](https://goo.gl/maps/dzUQm8TnzTtnYLcHA), worth the visit.\n\n\u200b\n\n**For relaxing**:\n\n\u2013 **The Canary Islands**: Small set of volcanic islands, with black sand beaches, resorts and nice people. I've been in Gran Canaria (where I recommend  the [Meloneras](https://goo.gl/maps/zKTKwfeFcwTTix4u5)/Maspalomas/Playa del Ingl\u00e9s zone) where beaches and weather are nice, and all hotels have lots of facilities; Also in Tenerife, where I prefer [Puerto de la Cruz](https://goo.gl/maps/xFpZW6g6frDN7B848), but probably the south part of the island would be sunnier. You can rent a car and go to the Teide's top (the volcano). I've been in Lanzarote too, but can't recommend it. Tourist trap, at least in my experience.\n\n\u2013 **Menorca and Mallorca**: Mallorca is a good place for relaxing, but it's been ages since my last visit, so I can't guarantee it. Never been in Menorca, but it's quite popular at the moment in Spain... therefore prices have raised a lot.\n\n\\----\n\nHope that helps. Also, Latin Spanish is as good as Castillian Spanish if you visit Spain, so don't worry. If your resources there are Latin Spanish but also easiest to find, it's ok. But if you are very interested, look for Spanish universities offering online courses. I've found [this one](https://cursosinternacionales.usal.es/es/cursos-de-espa%C3%B1ol-para-extranjeros) from a well-known university, but it's annoying that they are offering courses for non-spanish speakers but don't translate the page to english.\n\nCheers!",

            "It\u2019s a bit difficult to debug this, but have you tried the following?:\n\n- If your function uses storage, check permissions. A couple years ago I ran into something similar (function running ok, then suddenly throwing errors). You probably have to configure it via Google Cloud panel instead of firebase console.\n- Redeploy your function and try again.\n- Copy-paste your function, and deploy again with a different name. Then try to call it from the App. If it goes well, the original function is probably corrupted.\n- Check if you deployed it with the latest firebase tools, and if all libraries in your iOS and Android project are up to date.\n\nGood luck, and please post here if you find a solution or whatever is generating this error",

It has very low impact in the project\u2019s budget.\n\nAnother approach is to use function triggers to perform your tasks [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/database-events). For instance, when the user becomes online or writes some \u201ci want to join a group\u201d flag.\n\nOf course, you can always call your firebase cloud functions directly ([link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)) if you want to do it on demand.\n\nCheers!",
            "Hello! I\u2019ve a couple of projects in production with similar use cases. In my experience it is waaay easier to manage only one single firebase project with a single user auth management, an then separate each secondary project using different real time database or firestore nodes/collections.\n\nYou can achieve a good security level by using database rules (I think there is a good guide with practical examples out there, take a look here[Firebase database rules examples](https://gist.github.com/codediodeio/6dbce1305b9556c2136492522e2100f6)). You can also combine that with callable cloud functions instead of direct writting your data for an extra layer of security.\n\nSaid that, if you must use separate firebase projects, you can use the firebase admin SDK for cloud functions. You can initialize secondary firebase Apps with the admin SDK, each one with different auth, and use a callable function to send the user main auth account password (careful with this), create the user in the secondary project with same email and password, and then let the user know that both credentials are active.

            "Hello all. First things first, this is my first post. I like to read posts here, but I've never had any paranormal experience, and I'm not fluent at English so apologies in advance for grammar and also if this is out of the scope of this subreddit.\n\nSome members of my family have suffered from depression and other mental disorders, some cases were mild, others were serious. Thing is, they have been telling me their personal unexplained experiences for years, including hearing steps or voices in empty rooms, strange lights orbs, premonitory dreams, feeling of being observed, etc.\n\nI think most of these experiences have pretty logical explanations, so always considered it a spooky entertainment in familiar reunions and never gave them importance. Also, as several of these experiences took place when the witness were passing through a phase of depression or anxiety I didn't took it very seriously.\n\nA couple days ago, my wife and I were discussing about mental illness and odd behaviors (**context**: she is a computer scientist and belongs to a research group that tries to do an early diagnosis of mental illnesses by analyzing the way people write in posts, blogs, etc. So far they have had some success, and their results have helped several people, both patients and doctors) and the question popped up: what if the unexplained experiences my family told me were somehow related with their mental health at the moment?\n\nI made some calls to my father and my aunt (my grandma and my great uncle had some cool paranormal stories too, but sadly they passed away a few years ago) and got the following:\n\n\u2013 When both my father and aunt heard footsteps in the empty attic, they where children (8  10 years old) and where sleeping in the same room, in a two-story country house. It was in 1959 and the house was recently built. But this was right after their sister died from pneumonia (obviously I never met her), so they were truly affected and, in the words of my father, having \u00abone of the most terrible days of their entire life\u00bb. This experience was followed by my aunt hearing a voice (of a girl, but not her recently died sister, curiously) some weeks later.\n\n\u2013 My father claims that he dreamed with her aunt. In that dream, she didn't say anything; just stare at him with an unexpressive face and with a hand at her chest. That same morning the found his aunt drowned inside a water well. It was 1970 and something, the well was almost at the ground level, and everyone though she just tripped on and fell down. My father, who was very attached to her, became obsessed with that dream and was depressed for several weeks after that (at the point that he couldn't get out of bed or think in other things). Five years ago, my father had a heart stroke. Doctors told us that could be due to an hereditary disease, and now he is convinced that her aunt had a stroke and fell down into the well because the hand in the chest.\n\n\u2013  My aunt was diagnosed with a severe depression. Her husband and my cousin took care of here while she was at home. I remember seeing her a couple of times back then. She looked awful and smelled very bad (not like she were not washing herself, as their relatives ensured that. I think the word I'm trying to use is \"pungent\" but I'm not sure). Apparently during her illness, she felt observed by an invisible presence, even touched by it. As she was taking a lot of medications, her family thought she was hallucinating. She does not remember much of these events, but my cousin does, and still creeps her out, because she also started feeling observed sometimes.\n\nI have read several posts here in Reddit were people who tells their paranormal experiences also tells they were depressed, having very bad times, lost someone etc. So I would like to ask, **have you experimented something unexplainable while being depressed, anxious, or ill?** Do you think this is somehow connected?\n\n**\\[TL;DR\\]** I have the theory that people with some mild to severe symptoms of depression and other mental illnesses could be more likely to have paranormal experiences, and I'd be very grateful if you share your opinion or story.\n\nThanks guys, and stay safe!"

            "If you're going to go to Alhambra in the morning, you will need time to explore, around 3-4 hours would be enough. It's a huge place and you can explore a lot of things. Don't forget to buy the entrance in advance. Don't miss entering Palacio Nazar\u00edes and Generalife.\n\nThen, my recommendation to do in the afternoon: explore Sacromonte (the gypsy neighbourhood), walk through El paseo de los tristes, go to Mirador de San Nicol\u00e1s (the good spot to take a look at Alhambra with the whole Granada, also if you want to take photo with the background of Alhambra), go to Mirador de San Crist\u00f3bal (this is my personal preference, this place is way cooler than the previous one. The perfect time to go here is before sunset, so you can enjoy the sunset with the view of Granada and Alhambra. Highly recommended).\n\nIf you want to explore the foods, definitely try to order drink (beers, etc.) and they will give you tapas. You can find them around Plaza de la Trinidad or Calle Elvira, they are the hotspots of bars  restaurants. If you want to go to the bars or pubs, there are several zones to visit: Calle Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n, Plaza de los lobos (there's a place called Bohemia Jazz Caf\u00e9, it's cool).\n\nAnother thing, you definitely can explore the neighbourhood in the city because it has very particular style with Moorish influences.

For example, you can visit Sacromonte, the neighborhood of gypsies; their houses are based on caves. All those houses are painted in white. From there, you can also see the difference ambience between Alhambra and Sacromonte. Then, the foods. Visiting bars, enjoying the drinks and tapas are a must.\n\nHowever, in Sevilla, there are several historical places that can't be missed.

Then, they were also in charge of taking  melting the gold. I think they had more interaction \"before\" the heist, for example when she said that she wouldn't touch Bogot\u00e1 with a ten-foot pole.\n\nThen, I also noticed when Bogot\u00e1 commented on her about wearing the scuba suit, apparently she didn't react very strong as usual (e.g. when she shouted at Palermo that he's a \"machista\"). I don't know why, maybe she had a soft spot for him.\n\nAs we can see, the sparks became clear when Bogot\u00e1 nursed Nairobi, also made her that \"motorcycle\". All of his attention belongs to Nairobi. Maybe after she confessed her feelings toward Helsinki  almost got killed -plus the flashback scene with Helsinki when they talked about love-, she realized that the person that Helsinki referred to was Bogot\u00e1.\n\nEven though it was a little bit unclear and short, I like the relationships between them. Both have great work ethics. It broke my heart to watch the funeral scene, where Helsinki played the harmonica, then Bogot\u00e1 stood at the same place where Nairobi got shot  the cracked window framed exactly at Bogot\u00e1's heart...

            "TLDR; A friend whom I had history with barely responded my text, I want to confront him what's going on and ask him whether he still wants to talk to me or not.\n\nSo I [26F] have known this guy [25M] for a year. We kinda had a history as friends with benefits. Since he's back with his girlfriend, working as a freelancer plus studying, we barely talk. We only met several times. I really don't mind if we don't talk as much as before, but honestly I am kinda upset with his response lately.\n\nI sent him a Christmas greeting, he responded nicely but then when I asked him about his current final project of his study, he only read my text. But then NYE, I sent him another greeting. He also responded well, especially he remembered the things I've been through (July-November 2018 were extremely hard for me). Then I sent him text of thanking him for everything he has done to me, helping me through hard times,  showing me almost the entire island when I recently moved there. His next response? Nothing.\n\nWhen we met for the last time in November, he told me how sorry he was when he forgot to respond my messages. He read it, but he forgot to reply because of work (and other factors that he didn't tell me but I knew it). \"I always told myself to reply your text, text, reply her text>, but then I got distracted again by work. I am so sorry,\" he said.\n\nI still want to keep in touch with him because I consider him as a first good friend I know in this island, especially when I moved for the first time. We have good relationships. We already know each other well; we know each other's personal situations. He has helped me through some breakdowns I had during some difficult times (I live far away from my family  friends).\n\nAlso, as one of minor factors, having local friends in this island seems more difficult, based on my experience living in another city in the same country. To help with the cultural context, it's an island in a western Europe country.\n\nFor the record, I accidentally had feelings for him after 5 months, but at the same time he also confessed that he wanted to go back with her ex. BUT I don't have any intention of being in a romantic relationship with him. I only enjoy spending time with him, and that's it.\n\nI know at some points, silence is an answer but I'd rather hear it from himself whether he still wants to talk to me or not.\n\nShould I ask him what's wrong? If yes, what sentences are best to express my feelings and ask for his explanation?\n\nAt first I want to confront him by saying, \"Why don't you say anything to me? If I disturb you or don't want to talk to me anymore, it's better that you tell me right away.\" I have asked a friend but she said it's too harsh/direct so I better modify the words a bit.\n\nIf I finally confront him, whatever his response is, I definitely would respect it.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n---\n\nUpdate:\nHe just texted me. Seriously.\nWhoa. I hope he doesn't have Reddit account.",
            "Met several guys, 2 of them had great impacts on me. The 1st one we spent our time together for almost a year but now we don't talk too much because he's already back with his ex partner. But with him, he treated me well, he helped me through some breakdowns, and he made me realized that I actually deserved better things, since guys from my previous relationships had treated me awfully. I had an amazing time with him.\n\nThe 2nd, I thought I had found \"the one\". He thought the same. I learnt so much things from this situation; never ever get involved with someone too fast when you're still in the getting-to-know-each-other phase. I had complicated situation  he offered me to stay in his place. Since I had no other choice, I agreed. 2 weeks before I moved in, he suddenly freaked out  ended things between us, but I still moved in to his place because it's already a deal (I couldn't afford rent that time). Living with him for almost 2 months was a hell to me. It turned out to be the most toxic relationship I've ever had. He treated so bad, was mentally abusive by his words. Thankfully I could get out  never had any contact with him ever again. He's so manipulative.\n\nNow I almost lose hope on meeting someone new through online dating app because I am actually tired to get to know someone again  again, plus some of them end up with ghosting each other.",
            "I [26F] am still reminiscing every moments I had with M [25M].\n\nYes, I had feelings for him, even though at the first time I knew him, I didn\u2019t want to attach any feelings since what we did was casual. What we\u2019ve done, for me  for him, were intimate but we are only friends. You know that kind of relationship.\n\nWhen I met him for the first time, I didn\u2019t expect that I could get along with him very well. All I knew, during our initial conversation, he seemed nice and friendly. But then, that first night changed everything.\n\nThe way he treated me, the way he listened to me... He has set the bar so fucking high.\n\nI declared to myself that I didn\u2019t want to ruin our relationship by having feelings towards him. At first I was confident enough to resist myself.\n\nIt took 5 months to finally I admitted that I unintentionally catched feelings for him. I told him.\n\nMy heart hurt so much when I saw the way he interacted with his ex-girlfriend when we went to a medieval festival together. I knew there\u2019s something unfinished between them, especially I met him when they broke up for a couple of months. I burst into tears in secret that day. I called my friend, asking why it\u2019s so hurt to see it. They didn\u2019t do any stuffs like boyfriend and girlfriend, but my instincts were never wrong. I knew that he\u2019s still in love with her.\n\nAt night, I confessed. It was rough. It took a great deal towards our relationship.\n\nThen he revealed to me that he wanted to try to go back with his ex. That\u2019s why when we took a time to sleep in his car before he dropped me off at my home then he went back to his house (1 hour driving), we didn\u2019t do something that we usually did.\n\nI cried so hard. My heart ached. My head was dizzy.\nWe didn\u2019t talk much after that night. We didn\u2019t meet for 2 month after that. All I knew was he went back to his ex-girlfriend.\n\nTo be frank, when I was with B [30M] during the absence of my relationship with M, I couldn\u2019t forget about M. I secretly compared their treatments to me and the way they talked or argued with me. It\u2019s bad, I know. Each of them has their own personal characteristics and I liked them, but there\u2019s something I missed from M.\n\nLast july, we met again. He said he missed me. Oh okay. I missed him, too. A lot. That night we ended up doing something we usually did, but just because we knew we had rough time  we were badly affected by our own situations.\n\nThen in september before I left the city unexpectedly. That last night together with him was extremely sad yet memorable for me. It was possibly the best night ever with him. For the first time, we slow danced to the Nat King Cole\u2019s songs. We went to eat mexican foods, followed by drinking a lot in the pub next to the restaurant. We were so drunk but we sang a lot together, we hugged  kissed, we really enjoyed our time together. It\u2019s our ritual together. Again, he set the bar so damn high.\n\nI know that he\u2019s already with his girlfriend. They seem happy. They already have future plan together since their past-now-returning relationships.\n\nBut why it\u2019s so hard for me to forget about him? I even don\u2019t want him as a boyfriend, I see no future relationship with him, but I extremely enjoyed the thing we did together and the way he treated me. He helped me to realize that I deserve something beautiful and worthy.\n\nWe haven\u2019t talked much since I know he\u2019s busy with his job, study, and his girlfriend. But one day, in October, during a festival in the city where I lived next, I drunk-texted him, stated that I missed him. What a fool I was. But well, if I weren\u2019t drunk I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to tell him. He didn\u2019t reply.\n\nOf course, my move was absolutely garbage. I said \u201cI miss you\u201d to someone that already has girlfriend.\n\nBut again, he\u2019s my partner in singing songs in the car. We have similar taste. We always sang together. It\u2019s one of those things that I really miss to do with him. He\u2019s the guy who listened to all my stories when I was overwhelmed with my previous job. He\u2019s the guy who showed the island to me by going to almost every places I wanted to go from my list. He gave the sweetest, smoothest kisses.\n\nI miss the moment when we went to our favorite bar, in our favorite spot (2nd floor, on the left table in front of the stairs); drinking beers, telling each other's stories even though he mostly heard mine, holding hands when we talked (I don't know why he always did that), kissing his forehead  hair also he's kissing my hands...\n\nSo please tell me, is there any way to move on?",

            "TLDR; I keep comparing the way some guys treat me when we hook up with my previous experience with someone that significantly influenced my preferences of treatment during sex.\n\nSo last night I [26F] hooked up with someone [28M] that I've known for 3 weeks, and there's something that bothers me a lot. Even though I enjoyed the sex, I can't help but comparing what he did to the things that I usually did with M [25M]. M is a \"friend\", we regularly had sex since January but we completely stopped since last November because he's back with his ex. Because of him, I am able to explore my own sexual preferences  the treatment that I like.\n\nI really like what he did to me because he showed affection a lot during the time we did it. The guys I've hooked up with never did that to me, it's like whenever he finished he just said goodnight  slept facing the other side. With M, we always cuddled, I could sleep on his shoulder or his chest  he often hugged me. He also waited for me to finish (it takes a long time for this), followed my \"instructions\",  convinced me that the most important thing is we enjoy the moment; not only focusing to reach orgasm.\n\nBasically he has set the bar so damn high for me to receive such treatment whenever I am intimate with someone. I also could sense when a guy is being selfish (only wants to satisfy himself), and of course my experience with M became one of the factors.\n\nDuring June-July I was dating someone [30M] (period of M  I didn't meet because that's the time he told me he wanted to go back with his ex), I also unconsciously compared him to M, since I couldn't get the similar satisfaction I've had.\n\nThe guy from last night was kind, he always asked me what to do  to know if he hurt me or not. But again, the problem was I felt something missing when we're doing it even though I enjoyed it. We didn't finish last night but I felt bad because of this thought.\n\nSo I'd like to know, can I stop comparing what they do with my experiences with M? I know everyone is different in treating someone and it would be very selfish of me to compare them. Honestly I am afraid this would affect my personal judgment when I want to get to know someone  it would screw up my future romantic relationship.\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "When it comes to romantic love, I used to consider a person that makes me think, \"I like this person, we have something in common, we get along very well, he accepts me, and I want to be with him.\"\n\nAs you can see, it's more like a possession. I craved the desire of having that person as romantic partner based on the things that I thought it'd perfect for us.\n\nI recently learned something new about the concept of love. It feels and seems weird, to be honest. I was confused with what happened with my feelings and emotions.\n\nI always avoid to admit such feelings I have as \"love\". It's too strong. For me, if I love someone, it means I am willing to dedicate everything I have for this person.\n\nApparently, this new concept of love teaches me selflessness. It teaches me that I can dedicate my feelings without hoping anything in return.\n\nIn my case, I don't feel the urge to make him as mine. I don't see any reason to make him feel the same to me.\n\nI feel extremely comfortable with him. I trust him wholeheartedly.\n\nAfter spending a day together on the first day we met, I declared to myself that I didn't want to ruin anything between us. It's too good. Ruining in this case means I'd have feelings for him. Well, it seemed that I failed.\n\nSpending our spare time together, listening to music and singing along together, sharing each other's stories, drinking beers and vermouth as our rituals together are enough for me. It already makes me happy.\n\nI really don't get it why I always feel so emotional every time I am with him. Suddenly I shed a tear when I kissed him in the forehead. I felt a weird sensation in my heart when I hugged him tight. I felt so comfortable every time he touched me and held my hands.\n\nI also never expected I'd meet a person who could influence important aspect of my life. It's about self-worth; I deserve any beautiful things for myself.\n\nBut then, I see no future between us. Apart from my uncertain living condition in this country, his feelings are already dedicated to other person. He feels the thing that maybe similar with what I feel, but it's not for me.\n\nInstead of being disappointed, I am happy if he can have similar feelings with any person that makes him genuinely happy  allows him to be true of himself.\n\n\n(I wonder if you have experienced the same thing, or maybe you can explain what happened to me, because honestly I am not sure if the feelings that I have towards this person is love...)",

            "TLDR; This year is extremely challenging for my mental health.\n\nIt\u2019s possibly the topic that I (26F) rarely speak about. I thought everything is fine. I thought I can handle everything. But when I had several breakdowns, I slowly realized that I do need to convince myself that \u201cit\u2019s okay not to be (always) okay\u201d.\n\nMaybe it started with my mindset about myself. It has two extreme views: it can assure myself that I can handle every situations I have, but the other side, it is probably the most toxic mindset I\u2019ve ever had.\n\n\u201cI am different.\u201d\n\u201cI am tough. I look tough.\u201d\n\nSuch mentality has been stuck in my mind since I was a kid. I wasn\u2019t afraid to fight everyone who mocked my physical appearance, for example my hair. I did things that usually girls in my environment didn\u2019t have any interests in. For years I struggled to hide my insecurities about my body and my hair because they didn\u2019t achieve the \u201csocial standards\u201d. It took a lot of time to truly accept myself, no matter what people say about me.\n\nThat\u2019s where my mindset came. I always think to see everything through the positive side, not only the negative side. I convince myself that \u201cI am different and it\u2019s great\u201d. Also, \u201cI am tough\u201d, based on how I handled any cruel intentions from others.\n\nI like that mindset about myself. It\u2019s powerful for me. I never apologize to be who I am. Since I live abroad  independently, to be honest, I can live my life as I actually want. No need to hide anything, like I used to do before. This part, convincing myself that I am different and I am tough, I like it.\n\nBut when it comes to apply this mindset in my interpersonal life\u2026 That\u2019s when I think I am fucked up.\n\nTo be frank, I like being seen (or judged, you name it) as a tough, strong girl. Apparently the self-concept I\u2019ve made since I was little shaped my expectations towards people about myself. I don\u2019t like to be seen as a weak person. I don\u2019t want to show my vulnerable side (I only show them to my close friends).\n\nI try to keep myself calm when I am in a bad situation, don\u2019t want to show that I am so fucked up. I might be panic, and sometimes it shows, but I don\u2019t wanna look weak.\nThat\u2019s where I think that such concept is toxic for me.\nBecause I also think, \u201cOthers can handle similar situation well, why can\u2019t I?\u201d or, \u201cI am strong, I am tough, I don\u2019t want they see me like this.\u201d\n\nNot only that, I am also a person who is often optimistic. As I said before, I always try to see positive side more than the negative side, try to be neutral if there\u2019re conflicts, convince myself that everything will be okay\u2026\n\nIt actually leads me to mental state that isn\u2019t healthy. I am blinded by such concept, it affects my mindset in maintaining relationships with certain persons. And it\u2019s dangerous.\nThis year is the prove of everything. The dangerous side of my mindset. The turning point of my awareness towards my own mental  mind health. The uncontrollable situations that happened to me and the way I handled them.\n\nThis year is possibly hell for my mental and mind state. What I have been through, for fuck\u2019s sake, how can I survive??\nDoing a part-time job I\u2019ve never done before, being so far away from family  close friends plus not be able to go home, living in a place where I had limited mobility, taking care of a child and teaching him english, thinking about my next step after finishing my study, thinking about how to earn more money to survive in a country where its living cost is much higher than in my country\u2026 All those things happened while I was working on my final project of my study, which took almost a year to finish.\n\nWhen I lived in an island in Europe, I had difficulty to meet new people because of the mobility limitation I had. I was only able to go to the city center on the weekend. But then, I met some persons that influenced my life significantly.\n\nLong story short, I learned a lot that nobody will understand me as much as I am and I won\u2019t force it to them. Second, I met someone who helped me knowing myself more, that I deserve to receive anything beautiful, not only always having tough times. It\u2019s surprising that I learnt it from another person, because I was already blinded with my mindset that I was the one who needs to struggle and fix everything. In short, I don\u2019t give my own self a credit and also a break.\n\nDuring that time, I had 2 breakdowns, where I went to a beach and slept in a hotel alone, drank beers and ciders, did a secret thing, cried a lot, felt ache in my entire body\u2026 I was really alone. I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, even to my very close friend (I told her the other day), I asked the person who I knew I could rely on, but he couldn\u2019t. I really hate such feelings.\n\nThen the third, the fatal one\u2026 In short, I thought I have found something, trully being wanted by someone\u2026 But it turned out to be the most toxic relationship I ever had with someone. It also triggered the most toxic mindset I\u2019ve ever had in an uncontrollable situation, when I was actually not the problem:\n\n\u201cI can fix this situation/problem.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my fault, I started that.\u201d\n\u201cEverything is gonna be okay, I can change it.\u201d\n\nEven though I know the problem wasn\u2019t coming from me. Even that person treated me so badly. Even that person blocked me for illogical reasons. Even that person has promised a lot of thing, but he\u2019s the one who broke it. Even though I was the one who tried to calm everything down.\nThen situation forced me to live with this person for 1,5 months. I didn\u2019t have any choice. Guess what? I was treated awfully. This person was unbelievably mean to me; treated me like a trash. This person also told lies about myself to the others, but thankfully I had proves.\n\nBut I tried to handle it. I did. I convinced myself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry. I only need to survive, don\u2019t put my mind into it that much.\u201d\n\nDuring that time, my mental health was on the lowest point. I was looking for a job, I was struggling finding information about my visa, finishing final project for my study, having very limited economical resources, being brokenhearted for multiple times\u2026\n\nI kept it, I hid it, I only told my very close friends about my situation, lied to my parents\u2026 It cost me my own health.\n\nI missed my period for 2 months. I lost weight, not in a healthy way. I smoked a lot (like, really), I drank a lot, I didn\u2019t sleep very well. I was a mess. Maybe until now.\nNow I am in the process of healing. Try to evaluate my mindset. Try to relax myself. Try to forget the awful treatment I\u2019ve received in that toxic relationship. Try to keep myself busy with work.\n\nSee? That\u2019s my other problem. I like being distracted. I like being busy by work or everything that I can do. I am so stressed out if I don\u2019t do something. I like it because it doesn\u2019t make me overthink (too much). Oh well, another toxic behavior that I have, I guess.\n\nAt this moment I really need to evaluate my mental health, to remind myself that I deserve a break, I deserve to be treated well, I deserve to change myself, not stick to the toxic mindset forever\u2026\n\nSo, it\u2019s okay that this time I am not strong or tough as usual. I am mentally exhausted.",
            "First, I really recommend you to do a research about the study you want to choose. There are some studies that have bilingual programs, some of them don't. Apart from the program itself, I think learn Spanish before coming to the country is necessary because based on my experience, it would help you to interact with local people because not all people here can understand English (well, depend on the location). Also when you process your documents here upon your arrival, every documents are mostly written in Spanish plus you gotta deal with the staffs (but luckily some of them are able to understand English).\n\nFor example, I am from Asia, I am a graduate student in Spain, I learnt Spanish only 6 months before I started my study (my study is 100% in Spanish and it requires minimum level of B2)  the process to understand Spanish in such short time was overwhelming. So that's why it's extremely important to know what program you'd choose and where the university is, so you can prepare your plan in the matter of learning Spanish.",

We're gonna stay together for 1 night and I can't imagine how sad I will be when we're separated... We'll definitely have sex but I really wanna make it memorable, but at the same time I am afraid I'll burst into tears meanwhile I should enjoy my last time with him...",
            "Yes I've asked her and I tried to call her but she seemed not ready yet... Even to respond my texts, it took almost half day. Plus the time difference, 5 hours, also makes it a little bit complicated even though the difference isn't so significant.",

I've told her she can call me anytime when she wants to talk.\n\nDo you have any advice for me on how to deal with her grief, what should I tell her?\n\nI won't ask her to be something that she isn't capable of at the moment; I tell her to stay strong, but at the same I know it must be extremely hard for her to deal with such situation.",
            "I even can't describe what I am feeling towards this person. The first person who made me realize that I deserve something beautiful.\n\nI met this guy on tinder; he's the 4th person I met, and I was the 1st for him. After 2 weeks talking, we decided to meet. That day was amazing; we talked a lot, we're connected at so many things, until we sang along in his car until we forgot to leave the car. That night we ended up having sex, but that's the moment when I realized I deserved something beautiful. My experiences with my previous boyfriends and ex-friends with benefits were not really nice. Then came this guy, changed my perspectives about myself and my sexuality. That's just the 1st day we met. I also couldn't forget his kisses, just exactly what I wanted; soft and slowly.\n\nSince that day, we usually meet each weekend. I work during the week, and he studies also works. Since I am new to the island (I moved to an island in Spain since January, but already live in this country since 2 years ago to study), we regularly went to places I want to visit. He accompanied me each weekends and I couldn't be more happier.\n\nIt's been 5 months we're doing this; meeting each weekends, do our things (visit new places, eat and drink, lay down on a park or beach, talk about anything or personal stuffs, and have sex). He also doesn't hesitate to pick me up and drive me back to my house, even though he lives a little bit far from my house. He also came to visit me when I had the worst breakdown during my time here, which happened last week. I asked him to come to a place near his neighborhood. He spent 3 hours with me during the day that he already had plans with his friends, just to calm me down and accompany me.\n\nI'd say what I am doing with him is literally better than any relationships I had. At this point, we already shared our very personal stuffs to each other; for example, he told me that he's bi, he introduced me to his best friends and we already hung out for several times together, his first ex partner even wanted to meet me since they're still keeping in touch, until I met his last ex yesterday in an event. I couldn't count how many personal stuffs of mine I've told him, but I can make sure that I am so comfortable with him and I am glad that he can trust me that way. With him also, I became more confident in exploring my preferences of my sexuality.\n\nSpeaking about relationships, this is complicated. I don't know what I feel towards him, but what I do know is I really care for him, I don't want to ruin anything with him; the things that happen between us is already making me so happy. He broke up months ago and he's always been in  long term relationships. He told me he wants to take a break from relationships, but he told me he likes what we have now and we agree to get to know each other more. On the other side, I also have some fears of getting into an exclusive relationship because I've been single for 8 years and had horrible break up before.\n\nMy close friends are glad that I finally can meet a nice guy like him, but they also warned me to be careful; there's possibility that I'd fall in love with him, plus the circumstances won't support it.\n\nIt's almost July, I will finish my job here soon and I also will finish my study. I become more nervous, I want to stay here more, but I have to find another job here. The uncertainty of staying in this island also makes me afraid of losing him, actually.\n\nI am too comfortable with him. I talked to some guys and they asked me to meet, but I kept postponing it because I chose to spend my time with him.\n\nWhat am I feeling towards him? I really don't want to ruin things between me and him. I like what we have now, but at the same time I am afraid; my future in this place is unclear. Maybe it's gonna break my heart if finally I don't get any job here and I should go back to my country. I can't emphasize enough that I've never felt so happy for a long time like this.",

            "I'm from South East Asia. Began to learn Spanish since february 2017 by myself and 3 months went to a Spanish course level A1.1 with a teacher from Madrid. September 2017, moved to Ja\u00e9n to study and I was shocked listening to the Andalusian accent. I really wanted to cry when I spoke to anyone there because I couldn't understand them very well. Two years later, I feel overwhelmed yet lucky that I had experience practicing more Spanish in Ja\u00e9n because Andalusian accent (plus the culture and the people!) grows on me very well. At least I can understand other region's accent easier, since I consider Andalusian is the hardest one.",
            "At first I didn't want to try it, but I was so curious I read some articles on how to do it and how good it is. After having pregnancy scare for 2 weeks and finally I got my period, I talked to my guy about having sex when I have my period. We discussed it and we thought that we needed more time to get to know each other's sex preferences (because we just knew each other for 3 months).\n\nBut boy, I can't deny that during period, I am hornier than usual. I met him on the 2nd day and it's the wildest day for my period because I bled the most on that day. We went to a beach, and we found a spot where there's no one there between the bushes, we started to make out and did blow job to him. I am a person who is still new to sex (I've been sexually active for 1 year), and I am still shy to do new things. This day, it was completely different. Maybe because of the high libido from period and also relief from pregnancy scare, I went wild.\n\nWhen we went back to the hotel, we continued our make out session, until the part that we couldn't hold it any longer. He asked me to go with him to the bathroom, and we had sex there. I sat near the sink while he was fucking me. So, what did it feel?\n\nIt's was surprisingly great! I didn't need additional lubricant thanks to the blood. I didn't feel any pain when we had sex. Sometimes I can handle the pain, sometimes all I can do is laying down on the bed. I'd say that the sex helped me to ease the pain. Even though I didn't get the climax, I did enjoy the period sex. The result was also wild, tho. We were surprised how many blood was dripping on the floor, and our bodies (plus his hands) looked like we're escaping from a crime scene, hahaha.\n\nBut this is absolutely a personal preference, because some of us surely will be disgusted by the blood, can't handle the period pain so it will be difficult to have sex, or other reasons. You might enjoy it or dislike it at all.",
            "Whoa the similar thing happened to me and my guy (I don't know what to say, since we're not in relationships but we're more than friends also) last Sunday!\n\nWe had sex that night and it was fun, I was the one who had the orgasms, but he didn't. We decided to sleep after that. We're always naked while sleeping together.\n\nI didn't know how long we've been sleeping, but all of sudden he moved roughly, starting to masturbate and kiss me wildly! At that time I was still sleeping but when he started kissing me, I was like, \"Huh? Oh okay,\" and followed his lead, hahaha.\n\nWe did that until he finally came on my stomach, and we started to laugh, like, what the hell was going on?? He told me, \"I don't why, all of sudden I am horny as fuck.\" Then we quickly went to sleep again. In the morning, we talked about it again in a better state (already woke up) and we couldn't hold our laughter because we found it so hilarious.\n\nBut I don't know, is it common that a guy feels extremely horny while sleeping then masturbates consciously or even unconsciously?",
            "I was helping a 5 year-old boy to change his pajamas before he went to sleep. He looked upset because his mom is out of town until Monday to visit her mother and some friends. I asked him nicely to take his t-shirt off to change to his pajamas.\n\n(We speak in spanish)\n\"I miss my mom!\"\n\"Yes I know. Can you change your clothes, please?\"\n\nHe said that for several times and I was confused, I know he misses his mom but nothing I could do to bring her mom back. I only asked him to change his clothes until...\n\n\"I miss my mom! You don't understand!\"\n\nI could feel that my expression changed. I couldn't say anything, but I felt something hurt. Kid, you don't know how much I understand such situation.\n\nIt also surprised me how a 5 year-old kid could say something that felt like he stabbed me in the heart.\n\nI haven't seen my mom for 2 years since I moved to Spain to continue my study, and now I work as au pair meanwhile I finish my final work of my study. I am from Asia and it's so freaking far away from Spain, about 13000km distance. Been living with the family for 4 months.\n\nI could have said that to the kid right away, but I hold myself. To be honest, I almost cried.\n\nI really wanted to say, \"You know what? I understand! Why? I haven't seen my mom for 2 years! Can you imagine not to be able to talk in person with her, to eat sushi with her because it's our thing together, and to hug her?? I totally understand, but I survive! I try to be strong everyday! Even though now we're going to extremely different way of life (my mom is getting more conservative meanwhile I already quit practicing the religion, plus I got tattoo without her knowledge), I am sure you can't imagine living alone in another country, trying to survive and live better while each day you miss your parents.\"\n\nHis father came to his room because he's crying. He gave him a short speech on how to deal with such situation that he should be happy for her mother, too because she's having her great time now. Her mother actually doesn't travel so frequently, only 2 times since I live there and it's always for the same purpose. That time, I tried not to be too emotional. Then I went to the bathroom, tried to calm myself.\n\nI didn't say any word, I only listened to him that he misses his mom. I actually have a commitment to myself that I will never ever compare other's sadness with mine when someone tells me something. To tell that I can't see my mom for 2 years to that kid just to make him stop whining would have been the most selfish thing I've ever done.\n\nI simply listened, even though deep down I felt hurt.",
            "Yesterday, I finally had the chance to explore more my interests in sexual activities. So I am seeing this guy for three months and I know that he practices BDSM. Since the beginning we never did anything rough when having sex, but since I am still exploring what I like (and I never get orgasm through penetrative sex), I told him my desire to try BDSM.\n\nBefore I met him yesterday, I've browsed any information about it, and some reddit users here gave me great advices on how to begin. For example, to make a list of kinks I want and don't want to try.\n\nDuring the day, we did our things together [laying down on the sand/rock and listening to music], but it ended up with outdoor (oral) sex near a beach in the afternoon, where there was no one around and we really had great time.\n\nAt night, I showed him the list of kinks I'd like to try and he seemed excited that I had the time to find information and make the list. Oh boy, the sex was amazing and we did it twice and lasted for hours. I could get an orgasm after long time playing around and masturbating in front of him. Still not from penetrative sex, but finally I could get orgasm when I was with a partner.\n\nThat was also the first time I tried period sex. When we discussed it at the beach, we both thought to do it in another way when we already know each other's sexual interests much better. But you know what? We finally did it that night. It felt amazing and it did relieve the pain, even though at the end our bathroom looked like a crime scene that was full of blood (2nd day of period, it was a madness).\n\nI never thought that biting on the neck and other body parts really turned me on. I am huge fan of teasing, and I teased him so bad until I could see how powerful he was when he played his role as dom. Scratching the back, hair pulling, spanking, and also felt great for me!\n\nSo, I am happy that I finally have more chance to explore my sexual activities. I am also glad that I can do this with a person that isn't selfish (compared to my previous exes) and able to help me exploring my interests. Can't wait to try more things!",
            "Hello! Yes, something that I consider too much or beyond my capacity would be my hardest limits. I suppose I could find the list on other posts or other websites. Thank you for your comment!",

I am still lack of sex experiences, but to be honest I am interested in trying BDSM. I've read several articles and subreddit here, but I still need more explanation and advices.\n\nI've talked about this to him that I'd like to do more than the \"regular\" sex we have; we usually do foreplay, oral sex,  penetration (but I never reach the climax, neither does he. He told me it's also hard for him). A little bit background story, I became sexually active since last year. I am not sure if this is a problem that comes from myself or I haven't explored many things yet, I never have orgasm with penetrative sex, but I can have it when I masturbate.\n\nHe told me he still needs to know me and \"my limit\". Well, I even don't know my limit since I never have such experience before; that's why I want to try. But can you explain to me more about the limitation in the BDSM, especially when I am totally clueless about my own limit?\n\nHe also told me that he worries that on some points he might can't control himself when he becomes the dom. He said that sometimes he can be very rough, like pulling hair, biting, etc. I still have no idea how things might go if he said so, but I'm so curious to explore new things with him, since this is the first time I have sex with a guy who is selfless and truly gives me pleasure; this guy gives me huge impacts on my perspective about sex and self-worth.\n\nSome things that I do know about my preferences are I love teasing, I like to get more stimulation at my boobs, and I like that he penetrates me deeply. Then the thing I'd like to try first is to be blindfolded, spanked, and choked. I realized when we had sex for several times, he unintentionally chocked me softly and actually I kinda like it.",

            ">How do you actually know this?\n\nAre you claiming immortality?\n\n>Yikes\n\nYou're telling me that the fact that humans aren't immortal is a bad thing? There's countless amounts of literature refuting that.\n\nI can answer your small arguments that say, \"how could God have done this, isn't this evil!?\" individually, But generally speaking, if you read it plainly I guess maybe one might accidentally see it as evil for all people's standards, but its not really. Like the rapist one, I've always read it as, \"the rapist has an obligation to marry his victim and the victim has no obligation, especially if their father doesn't let them\", that's just an example of a possible reading.\n\nAlso, look at the time period. As per those people, it was entirely considered moral to do what the Israelites did and then when you take in the \"God is omnibenevolent\" it only makes sense that the Israelites felt that had to. But you cannot claim that you know the reason for the wars. If was not explicitly said to be to ethnically cleanse those people, then who are you to say, \"well it makes sense if that's the case and I like it\".\nIt appears to me your argument is based on the assumption that they did it for ethnic cleansing, end of story. From the perspective of a believer of the texts authenticity, why would your view on what happened necessarily be true. It just seems like an assumption and then this argument that, \"God says to do evil things\" is a claim based on an assumption, mine is too, dont get me wrong, but then I dont see how your claim is more correct that mine.\n\nIf you were to say that the historians say this is the case I'd respond that I dont think it has a place in this  conversation since my argument is based on the assumption of the authenticity of the texts which is doubted by historians.\n\nCould we just end this here. I dont wish to continue this. Just to be clear I didn't give up because of your points, its just that I see that we are (neither of our faults) going into circles and I didn't want to debate anyways.

            "I'm not claiming anyone was killed because they were evil and deserving of death penalty, simply that people can be killed and its not necessarily bad. And its assumed that if we did know why, we would agree with his behavior, that's the belief.\nThus from this you can only agree with his behavior.\n\nYes, it's strongly relied on the fact that god is omnibenevolent but I think its more relied on the fact that we don't know everything.\n\nGod is all powerful and god is all good and evil exists  therfore God is either not all powerful or not all good. This is just not necessarily true (I say this because it sounds like you were going towards this in your last paragraph)\n\nAnd even though he gave up on the argument of yours that not every killed person could have been evil, i find that odd because I think he was claiming something else entirely. He was saying there are reasons people die, Jesus died for one reason, everyone will die for one reason, soldiers die for one reason, sick babies die for one reason, etc. And since you dont necessarily always know the reason, you cant say it's evil.\nEveryone on earth will be killed by god in one way or another and this mass genocide of humanity isn't bad so why should we be so quick to say its bad when we look at these wars?\nYou are relying on the fact that we do in fact know why the wars were waged and why they were commanded this,  which is simply not true.\n\n\"Should you believe something that has a lot of ambiguity?\" is a different argument btw. I dont want to delve into should you believe in god.\n\nDoes god see killing non believers as a good thing? As per most people of these beliefs, I doubt it. I think they they don't believe god would do this because simply killing someone only because they are non believers causes more harm than good (which doesn't necessarily apply to this caGod.\n\nHopefully this makes sense.",
            ">I'll be honest, that is absolutely terrifying...\nI mightve made a mistake in explaining myself. I believe in the most general sense that killing babies is bad. There are many others who agree with that.\n\nSo it appears youre arguing multiple things. One is that killing many people is always wrong and two that god would've fixed the situation himself and since he didn't the war must've been tribal warfare.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong about the above because my answer will be based on this.\n\nI don't see an issue with  saying that in very few situations you're allowed to kill people, even babies especially if you were told this by god who's established to be good and all knowing or whatever, assuming one exists. (Sometimes we too are allowed to kill people btw according to the law)\n\nWhats different from hitler is that hitler usually isn't regarded as being omniscient but the god in Samuel is. And that's an important distinction to make. God being omniscient means he knows every possible outcome of every action and thus is trustworthy when it comes to is x good or is x bad. We on the other hand are not all knowing and don't have that kind of say sometimes. Sure, murder sounds terrible, murder of an innocent sounds even worse, but the belief is that innocent people can die when the outcome is significantly better than if they didn't.\nTake Jesus for example,  the innocent lamb who was killed. This was a bad thing that was actually good because it benefits people better than if he hadn't, as per the belief. I imagine the same or atleast a similar principle can be applied to the book of Samuel.\n\nSo I don't think there's reason to assume god didn't deal with the issue. The way he deals with the issue is by commanding the people. Anyways, to go from god didn't do it himself to therefore its tribal warfare is not an argument I'm exactly understanding.\n\nAnd regarding whether he was really answering thelegitductape, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. When I was reading it I saw how it applied to real life and the story and I don't wish to explain each of his points because it'll be annoying trying to study his intentions.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't divine command theory. I'm not explaining the argument that states that its good because god willed it. The argument is that it is good whether or not you know why and god commanded this good thing. It's a bit different but I still get your point.",
            ">Are you actually sure about that?\n\nI'm not the one claiming it, im just trying to explain the other dudes opinion which is based on this long lasting tradition on the view of God whether true or false.\n\n\n>Because in the context of the story, it was just tribal warfare, which is historically accurate.\n\nSo the thing is that people who follow these books don't always believe these wars are only tribal warfare. They commonly say that these were wars commanded by god in order to do something eternally good (whatever that means), not just petty fighting of two tribes being like, \"I don't like your god\".\nIt comes back to the first premise. The assumption is that we can't  be certain regarding the entire situation and thus we can't make claims such as that the babies were killed solely because they followed a different religion (To be clear, I'm not saying this is true, I'm saying this is one of their justifications for their belief) rather there's other possibilities which is what thatoneguy was trying to say.\n\n>To kill a baby just because it was being raised in a religion that didn't worship a god it didn't even know to exist?\n\nI personally agree with this and I'm sure many followers of these texts believes this statement too. But there is a question whether this statement actually applies back to the text in the book of Samuel.\n\n>but thatoneguy never really actually answered his questions\n\nIt looked to me that he did indeed answer the question. He was saying that in the context of killing a baby, morality is more complex than \"it is a fundamentally evil thing\". His hypothetical was his effort to show this, that even though something is normally bad, sometimes it can be the best thing to do.\nI felt that the other dude was just glossing over this,  and trying to get him to say, \"I think killing babies is okay\" which in only a specific case he agrees with, but usually he doesn't. This seemed more like a tactic to make him look dumb instead of trying to actually discuss things.\n\n\nI do have to mention the fact that the idea that god is always good and if he does something bad, it must actually be good in disguise is indeed a huge leap of faith. Wouldn't it be easier to just say that therefore god isn't good? But religious people will tend to say, \"when I say god is good, I dont mean we perceive every action of his as good, rather I mean that IF you were to see what he sees, you'd agree that its good (no one sees what God sees). You can call it mental gymnastics, but I'll just call it one of the views of god, and just because its justification isn't simple, I wouldn't disregard it.\n\nOnce again, apologies for writing more than I had planned, I can be repetitive.",
            "I don't really want to start a debate because I don't necessarily agree with either of the two lads.

Now the reason this is strange and disturbing is as I think  thatoneguy said that its such a rare event that in almost all cases it is a disgusting act, but there are times when disgusting acts are the best thing we can do and that \"best thing\" is called a good thing.\n\nThe other dude (atleast how it looked to me) just kept repeating that killing babies is bad therefore if you command to kill babies you are bad too which in my opinion is too simple of a representation of what makes things good and bad.\n\nI'm not advocating for the fact that killing babies is good or even sometimes good, I'm just saying (here's the part that really explains my comment) that thatoneguy seemed to be actually trying to answer the questions instead of constantly asking the same question and trying to find truth.\n\nI hope this answers you well enough.\nI wrote a lot more than expected, lol.",

For instance, the story line of big and little John that were living in Michael's childhood home. The movie spent a good 15 mins on those characters. Also, the Lonnie character. He just felt so out of place and forced. Finally, the hospital scenes were kind intense and there was too much time spent on creating this town-mob. It did not add much to move the story forward IMO.\n\nI was surprised with how long Kyle Richards lasted. I am a huge housewives fan, have been since the genesis so I was really excited to see her even though she's a terrible actress and thought for sure she'd be one of the first kills. But she lasted a while! Good for her.\n\nI loved the homage to Season of the Witch with the masks. That was a good little throwback.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the film and was really entertained.

Their mortgages were floating in Limbo, accruing interest and fees for years and years.. and the banks faced no consequences",

Then suddenly, in 2007-2008, their payments were being returned. No mail or contact from the lender (or subsidiary). There would be no assignment of mortgage in public records, for YEARS...\n\nUntil they heard from someone like me. And I would have to tell them, that they still owe this balance, PLUS any unpaid interest and late fees on top of the principal. Oftentimes this would be an additional 10-30% of their original principal balance.\nIf there was equity in the home, and they would not want to pay us? Their file was sent to our legal team to begin foreclosure.\n\nIf there wasn't equity, we would have to continue calling and attempt to collect.\n\nI only realized wtf happened in my last months. The big lenders and their subsidiaries just vanished, and the borrowers were stuck to foot the Bill.\n\nWhether these huge lenders were bailed out in one sum or NOT, does NOT change the fact that not a single person was put in jail for this.

Perhaps some quick sketched shadows around the cat's legs and feet to suggest positioning.\n\nAlso, proportions. Kitty's nose and mouth are very small compared to the eyes, which are too big for its head. If this is part of your style maybe try keeping the cartoony, sketched look while adding a bit of realism. The torso, too, and overall body shape are rather bulbous if you're aiming for a real-ish cat. There's not enough of a dip/curves for the tummy and hips, and the chest is too pronounced to keep with bone structure.\n\nI like the simplicity and the gentle touch of the roses.

I identity more with the millennial gen stuff but at times I find myself using older, outdated terms and re-thinking them - as a kid I picked them up subconsciously, as kids tend to do. For example, all my life my father ('47) referred to Asian people as \"orientals.\" I never called anyone that to their face but it took me until a few years ago to realize it can have racist implications. Same with \"colored.\" Made sense to child me because color is literally just color, not something inherently good or bad. White is white, brown is brown, etc. Literal colors.\n\nI hope that makes sense...other old phrases I've said I've had to explain to my peers or people younger than me, e.g. \"pig-headed\" meaning stubborn, among many others.

            "I know, random question to ask, specially in this subreddit. But I swear there\u2019s a point to this.\n\nSo I live with toxic parents (I\u2019m 20 and currently working to getting my own place but money is tight atm). One\u2019s a hoarder, the other has diagnosed anger issues, both are in their own way controlling over me, amongst other problems. Now over the past few weeks, roaches have started to appear over the house (I\u2019ve killed 12 in just over 10 minutes and I wasn\u2019t even able to get to all the ones I saw). I\u2019ve been vocal about my disgust towards this because they\u2019re everywhere. I had to throw out my toothbrush because there was one standing on the brush. My dad\u2019s bought a few generic roach strips with venom, but it\u2019s barely done anything. Surprisingly enough, given his anger issues he\u2019s barely demonstrated any disgust. No more than a regular person would be if he saw insects crawling a tree, which is certainly not the same reaction one should have to dozens of roaches in their home! My mom is pretty nonchalant about it too. She only kills them if she feels like it and if I ask her too cause I can\u2019t alone. So here\u2019s where my question comes in. By the way they\u2019re reacting they are making me feel like I\u2019m blowing this out of proportion and its actually normal to be living like this. So in your opinion, is it? Answer below and thank you :/\n\nAlso, please don\u2019t go into too much detail about dangers and whatnot. I\u2019m aware of them and I\u2019m already panicked enough. I guess I\u2019m just looking for some validation as many of us children of toxic parents do.",
            "What the title says :3 my mother hoards food that's been expired for months, sometimes years. She either hides it so nobody notices it or erases the expiration date on the container/bag and puts it in the freezer or fridge. She does hoard so many other things but this is actually harmful to our health you know. I used to be aware of this behavior and simply became extra picky on what I would eat around the house (which I think was a big part of why I developed an ED at 14). Now that I'm older though, I'm not only aware but she also does it in front of me and asks me to keep it a secret from my father. Although its not as if he didn't know, he helps me get new food whenever my S/O comes over cause well, obviously its gross to eat expired food but also because I was ashamed of having him come over and eating anything and he would just be here and be starving the entire time.\n\nShe does throw it away if anyone in the house points out that it looks visibly bad (if its rotten or has mold). But even then, she just kinda throws it all together in a container rather than putting it in the trash. And if me or my father take the initiative to throw it out, she looks through the trash and takes it out. We've gone as far as throwing it out in trash cans outside of the house, but I find it ridiculous that we have to go through such lengths to discard food that's just not eatable.\n\nSo the point of this is just that I find myself in a bad position because clearly what she's doing isn't okay. I'm 20 years old and at this point I'm just tired of being put in situations where one parent tells me to hide information from the other. \"Oh, don't tell your mom but I threw away all of these things\" and then she finds out and I have to deal with her frustration because we never told her. \"Oh, this is expired but I'm putting it in the freezer and erasing the expiration date so your dad doesn't find out and throws it out\" and then having to deal with the rants of my father who is diagnosed with anger issues. Its mentally draining.",
            "So I\u2019ve been wondering a lot lately, how do you tear a piece of toilet paper/paper towel? I live with a hoarder parent and its to an extent that we have cockroaches in the house (not a lot but enough for me to see at least 1 or 2 a day). Anyways, I\u2019ve noticed lately that instead of tearing toilet paper/paper towel from the top, I do it from the bottom. Idk if that makes sense.\n\nTake this emoji for instance: \ud83e\uddfb. If you turn the screen to the right you\u2019d see the toilet paper in a different position that you\u2019d see it if the screen is turned to the left. Well, I feel like the most natural way to tear a piece of this would be from the top (if the screen was to the right). Personally, I do it from the bottom (if the screen was to the left). I\u2019m wondering, is this common or is it a \u201cside effect\u201d (for lack of a better word) of my situation? Because the way I see it, by doing it my way I would use the side of the paper that wasn\u2019t exposed to the exterior where insects would have walked over it. But idk if that\u2019s just a common train of thought for everyone, hoarder parent or not.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for not being the best at explaining. :3",

            "I\u2019m rewatching the first Harry Potter movie for the hundred time, yet its the first time I start questioning some of the events. As we learn towards the end of the movie, Snape spent most of the year trying to save Harry. Quirrell himself admits it, which means Voldemort knew as well. I mean sure, Occlumency helped him hide his true motives and his work with the Order, but Voldemort lived through the events of that first movie. He must have known how Snape suspected Quirrell\u2019s intentions and actively defied him to prevent his resurrection, and yet he still took him back as a Death Eater. So, my question is, how did Snape manage to convince Voldemort that he was on his side when Voldemort himself knew he was part of the reason he never got the stone in the first place?",

My family had always like to poke fun at me for my weight and eating habits as a child, growing up female (I'm transgender to be clear, he/him) it felt they put these weird expectations on me to be \"healthier\" when really that just meant skinny to them. I ate a good diet, but their problem was I \"ate too much\" in their words at least.\n I have these memories of them locking the fridge and cabinets and tauntingly telling me I'm \"on a low diet\" but the memory that stuck out to me when I saw that label on the seasoning was when I was about maybe 7, my mother had bought my favourite crackers and of course I was eager to eat them. But almost immediately my brother made a comment about calorie labels. How because I was on this \"low diet\" I wasn't allowed to have more than the serving size (very small mind you) and in the moment of remembering that my eyes started to well up with tears and I felt almost ashamed and panicked to be eating normal sized meals again.

I didn't even get a refund and if I try to buy another even more safe one I would get fined.

My current wheels are 72mm on front two, 76mm on back. 84a. I'm generally just riding an asphalt trail from point\u200d A to point B and back, but I also like to pivot and skate backwards sometimes (got to impress strangers while The Descendents blare in my ears). Nothing fancier than that. So I have a few specific questions but any general advice would be much appreciated: 1 - What's a good price range or brand to get? I'm down to invest in good wheels if they last. But I don't know the difference between $90 set and a $20 set. 2 - Is 80mm to 76 a good size from what I'm doing? I like the current size I have but I don't know anything else, and online research seems to support this size. 3 - uhh Hardness? Article says 84a is good for outdoors. I had no idea what that was until 30 min ago. Anyway I'm looking at a set of Labeda Wheels on Amazon. No local skate shops here. $60, 85a and 80mm - 76mm. Advice?",

I'm remember laughing almost hysterically the first time I counted my calories and realised how calories rich junk food was!\n\nmy pack of chips was almost the same (512 calories) if not more that 1 serving of Dal (lentils), 1 serving of green veggies and 2 Rotis (small Indian flat bread prepared from whole grain flour).

I need ideas an inspiration for easy to make foods when you have little time.\n\nMy tips:\n\n1. Sit and understand Protein, Fat, Carbs and Fiber.\n\nYou'll spend a little time upfront but man oh man does it help in the long run to understand what's working for you and how to hack your eating habits.\n\n\n2. Eat as close to original as possible (Buy whole Foods). The more processed the food, the more it will (90% of the time in India) be calorie rich and odd portions. I buy veggies, lentils, fruits etc. Once a week after I plan what I am cooking thereby reducing wastage, its cheaper and I am not stressed wach day as to what am I cooking.\n\n\n3. Try different cuisines - while some recipes are universal, I feel most of us have a cuisine that we grew up with and it's close to our hearts and mouth. For my partner it's a burger - she can survive on just 1 good burger. So she makes it as healthy as she can has it with huge salad (greens fill you up plus fiber \ud83d\ude0a)\n\nWhile I eat traditional northern Indian cuisine cause it makes me feel full and keeps me satiated plus I'm vegan so I stick to eating what I know.\n\nFind recipes that you like, tweak them to add more protein and fiber.",

I was practicing OMAD and I'm a vegan, I was calorie counting and weighing myself, going on walks - basically I could taste my 50Kg goal gleaming in front of me, my own pot of gold.\n\n\nThen Shit happened !!!\nI let myself drown in my head and no one  nothing made sense anymore.\n\n\nFast forward to June 2021 - I'm 80Kg and ready to get back on the saddle, reach 65Kg again and basically telling my body to 'get a move on'. Guess what, its August 2021 and I was 85kg ( so \u2b06\ufe0f 5Kg plus the 15Kg that I anyways had put on), miserable and doubting everything.\n\n\nSo, I took a breath! And started small. Yes again, after 8 tries (not fails, tries) on 1st September!\n\n\nMy ONLY GOAL for the month of September is not to eat from outside - basically anything that's not cooked in my kitchen. I can eat anything, as many times and with as many helpings. (plus I have cut out sugar completely as it's a trigger for my migraines).\n\nToday 9 days in, I see the following results:\n\n\n1. I am down to 82Kg from 85kg. (I caved in and weighed myself today morning)\n2. I am not spending as much as I used too.\n3. I am NOT bloated!\n4. I am enjoying cooking again - the ritual of it, the scents, the excitement of recipes.\n5. Drinking more water.\n6. My bra fits better \ud83e\udd17\n\n\n\n\nFor me, this is working so far - 1 small step and then seeing how positively its affecting me.

            "It's late so forgive my typos and order of the list. OK, that being said, here goes:\n\n\n#Tips\n\n\n1. Take consent prior to taking their contact details or before adding them to any groups of any sorts - telegram, WhatsApp etc.\n\n\n2. Always take consent (and enforce this) if people are keen on taking photos and/or posting these. One never knows where these pop up and under which title. Noone wants to be outed before they are ready.\n\n\n3. Have a forum where people feel welcome (look up icebreakers games and a round of their names and pronouns) and heard (small intros of whatever they are comfy/identity with).Mistakes happen and till they are genuine (err on the side of caution) in terms of mis-pronounication.\n\n\n4. While some are open to all, some groups only have people from the community and its NOT open to allies. Other groups like to pre-check who is attending (and yes the responsibility in on the organiser) so that the meeting is a safe space. Think on these lines and see how you want to start.\n\n\n5. Use an accessible (transport and money wise) venue. Too rich, too far, too late in the day - these will just raise the barrier to access to the group. Basically ensure to the best of your abilities that it's inclusive and be ready to modify. Once we changed a location last minute as one person couldn't take the stairs.\n\n\n6. understand whatever is lacking and develop organically. It's a process and you will get there.\n\n\n7. Have a plan of action if your group is harassed in public or a heckler/troll turns up. Always speak in a clam tone and end the issue (sorry but one need to be mentally prepared - it's half the battle won).\n\n\n\n\nCheers, you'll do good.

The difference was a full 180 mins \ud83e\udd37 and I was like why am I shelling out money to feel hungry so quickly.\n\n\nTook me about 6 weeks to understand what a 1200 cal for a day looked and felt like. I started by shaving off 100 calories and then sustaining it for a week or 10 days till I reached 1200 a day. Plus on days if I am really like really hungry, I always keep some pre-portioned nuts that will bring me to my maintainance calories for the day (around 300 calories more). My rule is not to eat chips cause I am barrel through an entire pack without a smidgen of control.

So, for now, we switch it all off.\n\n\n2. Track - I tracked all that I was eating for a week. Simple rule - if I'm eating it whether a single chip or a salad; I noted it. Use any free app to track what I was eating and hence the amount of calories I was consuming. Pro tip: Keep noting the timing also.\n\n\n3. TDEE - I wanted to see what actually should be my total calorie intake and energy I was burning. I used this free website to do so (TDEE calculator) https://tdeecalculator.net/\n\n\n__so now I had the daily calories I WAS eating and WHAT they should be. I wanted to stick to small deficit (please don't go over 500 calories daily deficit) so I did the following__\n\n\n\n4. Understand Food Patterns - Once I saw WHAT I was eating and WHEN - I felt better prepared. Example: I stopped carrying extra change so I couldn't be tempting to sweets or candy or an errant packet of chips \ud83e\udd37 I planned my meals for the next day in advance so I wouldn't stress and eat out. This helped me with keeping an eye on my calories and budget. \ud83d\ude4f I stopped eating sweets and boy, did it help with my teeth and my moods \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\n5. Calories, Calories - Once I started eating more and more at home (cheaper and better prepared too). This helped me realise that (without getting too much into macros) I WAS eating better. More protein helped me stay satiated for longer, hence my snacking reduced and finally eliminated. I was eating what I wanted and portions weren't a problem since I was calories counting thanking to my app.\n\n\n\n6. Walking - I started walking to just MOVE. For 5 mins and then it became 15 mins or 4 good songs, all queued up. As my body moved and sweated, I enjoyed it more and MORE, at a gentle pace or not, I liked moving :) (I hope to run a 5k in my life but that's a story for another day)\n\n\n\n\nAll I am trying to say is - the day I realised that this is the only body I got so I ain't gonna beat it any more, I want to fall in love with myself :) and all the choices became, I dunno, simple after that.    I skate by on bare minimum and I do whatever I can - sure I make mistakes but I note them down, understand them and move on :) and so can YOU.\n\n\nHappy to help if you wanna talk more friend :)",

Cops and us, we are in a relationship by now.\n\nI remember, dancing in the rain when 377 got repealed.

            "Contrary to other opinions, I would say, PLEASE DON'T GET A DOG. I'll try and explain it better.\n\n1. Economic reasons - having another being in the house is an added expense. I have 2 dogs and ill give their monthly breakdown - raw chicken at 1000, veggies at 2000, rice 6kg @35, eggs 2 a day @ 80 per dozen. Their annual vaccines and all come to around 4000 per dog. Spaying comes at 5k but I'm sure this depends from vet to vet. Plus you'll buy toys and all.\n\n\n2. Physical Reasons - if it's a puppy then you have to potty train and generally train the dog too. Your parents might want to do that on their own or hire a trainer. Dogs can and do yank quite hard on their leashes and this can results in falls. A member of my family fell just last week when one of the dogs got spooked by a cat. Plus laws are becoming strict about cleaning up behind your dog and one needs to see if your mom and dad are okay with it. A dog, esp when young need plenty of exercise, without which they tend to chew households items starting with slippers. You needs to truly assess whether your parents can manage a perpetual 3yr old.\n\n\n3. Parents - Please talk to them and see if they want a dog or not. And I'm saying this with the utmost respect but at times we feel we need to fill a space where as our parents might have things planned and might not want MORE responsibility for another 14-15 years of their lives. Cause one can't leave a dog alone while taking a vacation and kennels also cost (again).\n\n\n4. Why I feel to say all this - my friends and I feed around 100 dogs through our NGO. It started during the pandemic and I cannot begin to explain how many people abandoned or were forced to give up their dogs due to monetary or other reasons. One lab got adopted and abandoned 3 times - with the 3rd owner choosing to put the animal down. I've seen cases where parents have got a pup (desi or otherwise) and few months later, surrendered them as 'the dog is too active' or keep the dog tied up 'as the house gets dirty' etc.\n\n\nMy humblest of requests would be to talk honesty with your parents, maybe your mom enjoys books or movies or an activity that can engage her without tiring her out completely. Or maybe she wants a dog and welcomes everything that comes with and loves the furry companion \ud83d\udc36\n\nI'm happy to talk more about this but high maintenance pets are not a solution to fill a space.\n\nMy own cousin had to surrender the dog he got as a surprise for his parents when he was shifting to Japan. His parents straight up said no, we cannot handle a dog at our age (they both are 58-60).\n\nEdit - I have a Beagle and a Desi.",

If someone was to slap her then how are they any better than her, being above the law and taking it into their own hands.\n\nIn my case, I've seen a woman slap a cop (while her husband argued and screamed with him). my friend and I literally held them at the scene while she screamed, spat (thankfully it was pre-covid) and gave gallis to esp to me saying woman ain't helping a woman. That time all I said was as a woman I will give gavahi in court that she hit a cop and woman to woman - she was being an entitled li'l bitch. We helped, as the cop at the scene was alone (public was only watching) and had called a lady constable (and back up). We did it with full support of the cop but we didn't go around beating her or her husband. 20mins of this tamasha and then more cops arrived. But in the meanwhile, we didn't commit more violence, only restrained her and husband.\n\n That's the only way I saw myself being fair - cause I need to live with my actions everyday, long after such shit is forgotten by all. But ghar jaake bahut baar face wash kiya tha \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd if you see the various posts esp the twitter thread, this woman clicks posts and is a general entitled busybody types.

If anyone is wearing gloves, please show utmost precaution and spray sanitizer on them and dispose them properly. We have actually started encouraging people to use them as last resort or if actively involved in caregiving.\n\n2. Never touch your mask. Always take them off with the ear-band, if both hands as if they were Ray-Ban glasses, and keep them in the sun (ideally in a paper bag) for a couple of hours post usage. This is esp for N95 as they ain't washable. This protocol decontaminates them post usage. (the other day I was telling this to someone and he is like 'agar dhool lag gayi toh.

The people from whom I was renting a room, urged me to go to there and when I entered the temple, I was completely out of place. But It was peaceful and as I stood before the idol of Lord Shiva, I folded my hands above my head and shut my eyes, the entire temple erupted with music. It was transformational - I think I felt God at that moment. When I opened my eyes, the temple musicians were playing their evening ragas. I came out with tears of gratitude.\n\nLast year, I dreamt of a person in black robes, holding my hand and making me take a stone staircase and upon climbing I came across a lake where Lord Shiva was lying down and sleeping. I started a jaap of gratitude and that night, in my dreams a male voice spoke to me about visualisation of my dreams.

            "I am putting some basics down, that I put together for my free  cooking classes, to broke ass college students and I myself still go by these pointers. They are time and money savers in long run.\n\nBasics to Recipes and Reducing Kitchen Stress\n\n1. Staples - Review your meals and see what you eat the most - it can be rice, lentils, pasta, noodles, all kinds of flours etc. These should always be bought monthly and stored nicely so they are always at hand. They are your Staples for a reason. For ex. Whenever I can't decide what to eat the next day, I always soak white chickpeas. That ways in the morning, I will always have access to, after a quick boil, to boiled chickpeas for salads, curries, heck even chickpeas rice stir fry. If I have the ingredients - dish will work itself out. I always have these plus spaghetti, flour and basic dry noodles in the house.\n\nFor me onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, lemon and potatoes are also Staples.\n\n\n2. Cuisines and Spices- Choose all the cuisines you like to cook. I suggest to start with 2 or 3. Once you have decided, look up commonalities and you will see spices overlap.\n\nFor example - I mainly cook North Indian, French, Japanese and between these I can cook (with a few additions) the basics of Mexican and South Indian, some basic Thai, Cantonese and Korean dishes too.\n\nThis help you understand also how to substitute spices and more importantly use up the spices in your kitchen before they go stale. They are expensive.\n\n3. Whole Spices - Always, I mean always, try and buy whole spices. Not cinnamon powder but basic cinnamon bark (not the expensive smooth kind also.)same cloves, star anise, nutmeg, cardamom etc. They charge you for peeling and grinding and the pretty box (most of the times). Whole spices retain their Oils hence they last longer, are more fragrant and can be roasted/toasted prior to cooking for a few seconds.\n\n4. Sauces - Gok explains it much better than I can hope to so I am putting a link for his video below. In essence, for every cuisine atleast for basic level, there are certain sauces one should have. The whole idea is to reduce the 4pm panic about what to cook because you have a cupboard full of stuff that goes well together. Whichever cuisine floats your boat - Thai then have coconut milk at hand, can't do chines/japanese with Soy and I personally always have oyster (for my partner), Woostershire, Sriracha, mirin, vinegar in the house.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/31Zo38zw_u8\n\n5. Veggies - please buy seasonal cause they will cheap, suited to the season, not pumped with additives to keep them looking pretty. Plus a lot of youtube cooks and blogs do seasonal recipes so you won't be bored.\n\n\n6. Utensils - a lot of people get deterred because when they cook it burns or some other mishap happens and they feel demotivated. Plus one has classes and tests and fun to be do. Buy 3 or 4 basic but the best quality utensils you can buy. Your utensil should perform it's function, that all. 1 or 2 saucepans (for 2-3 people so you can boil stuff in it plus make sauces and soups and curries), 1 or 2 pans for your omlettes, stir frys, 1 rice maker (only if you eat rice the way, well I do, that means 2 times a day) and a couple of lids. And 2 silicone spatulas, 1 strainer (works for noodles, pastas, veggies, dumplings etc) , 1 tongs cause these are wayyyyy better than anything else and wash easy.\n\nYou don't need a tagine to make a curry. Similarly I use my steamer to make momos, Dhokla and idli.\n\n\nAnd last but not in the least, make a LIST of veggies and fresh additional produce like fruits AND then go to buy it all.\n\nThat ways you are also planning and sorting your week's worth of meals plus the Staples are already there.\n\nAnd and And use OIL - most recipes are by cooks who have been cooking them for a while. One learns to eyeball these things in the long run but when in doubt an additional 1/2tsp (then the recipe calls for) of oil will save your stir-frys, curries, meats from burning.\n\n\nWe eat 2 to 3 times a day. Might as well cook to the best of our abilities, save money and impress our tummies. Cheers.\n\n\nAnd as always, please add your tips and tricks that you use to eat healthier and cheaper. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",

TRANSFORM yourself and your hate/anger into acceptance please before you are left out on the sidewalk alone and forgotten.\n\nACCEPTANCE OF ALL DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO BEING A DOORMAT!\n\nI am 35 and fucking pissed Indian lesbian who is tired of losing people, especially my younger friends to BULLYING !!! You never pick on people who will give it back to you and to prey on the vulnerable from within the community is just so heinous and downright evil that I truly wish nothing of note of you.\n\n\nAND YOU, ALL OF YOU, beautiful beautiful PEOPLE, who feel threatened or have had shit hurled at you in these online forums that are supposed to be safe spaces -\n\nI SEE YOU, I HEAR YOU, I AM OLDER SO I MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE TO CATCH UP WITH THE CORRECT PRONOUNS BUT I STAND WITH YOU, FUCKING ALL THE WAY!!!\n\nStruggle is struggle and we have to be cognizant of that. Stay strong and this SHIT does get better!\n\nYou all are worth so much than your weight in gold, DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.\n\nand most importantly, seek help and support if you are feeling alone, there are many of us out there who will love and support you.\n\nYOU ARE NOT ALONE, repeat this daily!\n\n\nWith Love and in Rage\n\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\n\n(Sorry, I have just returned from the funeral of a young 20 yr old queer ftm friend.

            "India is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sisters.\nI love my country, and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage.\nI shall always strive to be worthy of it.\nI shall give respect to my parents, teachers and all the elders, and treat everyone with courtesy.\nTo my country and my people, I pledge my devotion.\nIn their well being and prosperity alone, lies my happiness.\n\n\n\n[National Pledge ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Pledge_(India))",
            "I grew up in India! An idea of India more than its geographical boundaries, was taught to us in the 90s - we were supposed to be harbingers of peace and bring renown to our country. J'ai Jawan J'ai Kisan!I promise you, we were taught love and \u00e0 belief in universal brotherhood (India is my country and all Indians are my brother's and sisters... Yup that one, that pledge). We were supposed to work hard and take our place in the world.\n\n In 2000s, I came to college and as a woman I was taught to be fearless and to stand tall against patriarchy and to use my privilege in society to work for those to whom this was denied. Volunteer work was compulsory, we were shown the good and the ugly and taught to figure our spaces between. We saw Rang de basanti and bought what the movie sold us and believed candlelight vigil will show us the face of Jessica's killer. We thought and we dreamed. College ended and life happened - corporate jobs, NGOs, postings abroad beckoned us. But we returned to lend our shoulders, when Nirbhaya happened- we protested, we the many, who were lathi charged and  water cannoned.\n\nAnd then last year where so many laws were passed that they ended up strengthening our tired resolve - we fought, each hour and each day, at each sit in and each protest, the fabled dilli ki sardi, was warmed by singing songs of resistence. We thought that people will surely realise reason and logic and compassion and not say that we traded our love for our country  for packets of biryani. We were chased and picked up and dropped at random bus-stops at the edges of Delhi. The marks of the lathi from my thighs took almost 7 weeks to fade but many were injured and I feel it's narcissistic of me to talk about myself. We were pushed out from Jantar Mantar, the centre of Delhi, so we took refuge in its corners. But then came February  and few of us rushed back from all corners of India because the tyre market had been burnt and I read about Akbari. So i saw how they looted our safety and rioted in my Delhi, but being a 1000 yr city breeds resilience into the very water, so we ran medical camps, carried dead bodies and the pregnant to the hospitals, collected donations and donated ration kits and then ran food kitchens for the our fellow Indians who got turned into migrants cause by succeeding covid lockdowns. Why, cause kyunki yeh mera dharm hai - this is what was taught to us - to help. By July, we we were battered and bruised and tired. Tiredness that somehow had seeped into my bones and made a pact with cynicism to take up residence.\n\n\nAnd this poor 19 yr old was gang raped, her spine was broken, and then when she died, they didn't let her family see her body and she was burned, turned into a rape statistic. Something broke inside me and most of the people I have spoken with. I feel like an outsider in my beloved country, I don't know my place anymore. I feel cheated somehow! I am so sorry Ms. Valmiki we failed you - we the id\u00e9alists of India with our rose tainted glasses and glib all encompassing morals. I was born in UP, I know what the state is and rather was. I dunno it anymore - haven't been back in 3 years.\n\nAll I know is that when we had strength, we should have fought harder earlier, that you were born in a safe world. I'm sorry my sister, I'm sorry.\n(This is a rant. It's a navel gazing exercise, It's my catharsis cause I have never felt so tired and so powerless in my own country ever before and a part of my brain keeps yelling at me that the worse is yet to come so I should hoard my tears). This ain't intended to hurt anyone and if this pisses you off, I'm sorry. I want this here, at one place where noone knows me so i can keep coming back to reflect.",

(Sidenote: she has photos of one of our dogs sleeping on me and I didn't wake up)\n\nAnywho, today, I set my wristwatch' alarm to buzz and it woke me up at 5.25am so I let the dogs out. I was beaming with pride and I excitedly tapped her and said, 'Hon, guess who let the dogs out. Me :)' and I ended up waking her \ud83d\ude14 she can't go back to sleep once wake so today too, despite best of intentions, she woke up.\n\nShe did say everyday is an adventure (we've been together 7 yrs) and has been laughing the whole day about this, called my dad about it too (and I heard him roaring too \ud83d\ude02) and also played the song a few times \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIt's nothing major, just basic domestic bliss but  wanted to share \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08",

And then it hit me - I needed to start at the basis of this certified madness \ud83d\ude09.\n\nI listened to Andy' podcast again. The rules couldn't be simpler. It's was he says about doing what we can with what we have struck me! He says 45 Mins but he NEVER said that I have to become a human flag overnight - that mistake is mine ALONE. If I have to be honest, I'll say that I 'broke' my streak cause I felt I couldn't do it and then used that failure as an an excuse to further dig my own hole.\n\nSo, I have planned a 75*2x plan of 45 Mins workouts (I'm overweight so i can't do what most people do) and thrown in a healthy mix of stretching, baby weights, long long walks (that's one thing I can do) so that I don't flounder in that area. And this is for me, overcoming a hump :) I'm tired of taking the easy way out.\n\nI'm not the fittest challenger (35,F) but I'll definitely become a finisher of #75Hard.\n\n\nHere's to DAY 1 #75Hard",

I'm still kinda processing it and this is more of a post for myself but also had to share cause it helped me.\n\nBackground - I've been on OMAD for the last 2 yrs (on and off) and my frequently water fast for upto 48 to 60 hours. Somehow haven't been able to Crack it so far.\n\nPresent - I'm on a 72(+) hour fast and while the first 60hrs were a relative breeze, hunger wise, on the 61st hr hunger started bitchslapping me around. And then it hit me. I missed chewing!!! Like not hungry but just the action! And somehow along with that I was able to differentiate between my hunger and cravings. Upon listening to my body I've realised that while normal hunger starts under my navel (and layers of belly fat) but it's a gentle and it's a low lying feeling  (I'm aware of it but it's manageable and chill) vs craving or mental hunger which comes as intense as as heat in June and subsumes everything. But as its this intense for me, it only lasts 5 or so mins and I need to do something to distract myself. I physically talked to myself to back off from buying chips and a coke!!! And these come like 4 times today. And each time I didn't succumb, it was a new craving, more intense but for a lesser duration. (I find it extremely interesting).\n\nResult - I've crossed the 72hr mark and now hoping to go for a 100 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd17\n\nTL/DR: Finally learnt the body signals between mental and physical hunger, used them to not succumb to cravings and finally cross the 72hr mark.",

Can we have a kinks collective-esqu subreddit where people can freely interactive without worrying about any backlash or their post getting lost between two news articles.\nI completely believe that here in India we need the anonymity that internet provides us and loneliness is huge in the our community because we are isolated in IRL. Hence some guidelines would help all of us navigate this subreddit better. Plus maybe some active discussion topics and interactions would make this a more active Reddit. Cheers. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08",

I am on a 72 hr water fast and 32 hr in, out of habit I started scrolling through food delivery apps to see if anything caught me fancy (normally everything does and it ends up in my tummy). I saw all my previously ordered dishes, each photo reminded me of their taste on my mouth but AFTER 40 MINS, I (for the first TIME) just shut the apps without ORDERING ANYTHING. I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT, I WANTED TO CONTINUE MY FAST. I don't possess iron will guys - this has NEVER HAPPENED Before well with me atleast. I am in shock but feeling slightly less fragile - hopefully onwards and upwards from this point towards my first successful 72 hr fast.\n\nI just wanted to share this here cause in the past I have drawn strength and inspiration from all you amazing people and for the first time i have something to give - we can do it guys, 1 hr  1 day at a time\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\ude4f\n\nTL, Dr - First time didn't order home delivery during my fast.",

We are the underdog faction there since the start, but that isnt a problem for us we are trying our best. It started wild with covenants pushing hard and Zerging the whole map. Purple then went on to fight back. We soon realized there was a feud between to big clans in this server that has been ported from ESO. The Saints (Covenants) vs SDC \"Slick Daddy Club\" (Syndicate). So yea we are in midst of all this and we manage to hold on to two of our territories. Whilst purple has claimed everything else besides our 2 and 2 of the covenants zones.\n\nSo we as marauders dont step back we keep pushing and pushing making wars everywhere winning on defence and losing on attack.\n\nThen the first big accident happened. Attack war on Reekwater, we were pumped. All in the faction discord of our server, many different companies united people from europe and even asia/north africa in the same discord translating strats and hyped to do our most fierce attack since launch.\n\nThe war started our plan did unfold like music for the first 2 points, but while taking the second one the lag started. Those gauntlets spamming like crazy and you all already know the drill. We fought our best war but still lost against the Slick daddys because of their exploit, that was a hard one to swallow and we all felt helpless since it felt so damn unfair, with all the time we have commited to this game and server, we dont want to leave.\n\nAll this takes us to yesterday, Monarch's bluff on war, our capital we have to defend against the Slick daddys or well get pushed back to just 1 territory and the tax hell will expand even further. Can you guys guess what happened?\n\n[This happened.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T21RcQP9K_w=Bartin7)\n\nAnd again the slick daddys who control the whole map have to abuse exploits to win yet another dirty war. So we are now looking into this and it seems like the slick daddys is a huge community known in other games for their griefing, exploiting, toxicity and racist behaviour.\n\n[Post in another mmo about this clan and its behaviour](https://www.reddit.com/r/lastoasis/comments/giwhgs/clan_of_250_people_abusing_bagscheats/?utm_medium=android_app=share)\n\nI dont know... I just sincerely hope they get banned, its what they deserve they dont play fair and they shouldnt be able to ruin a server like this, they cant even win when we fight fairly and right now they are being rewarded by the game with the way they are playing.\n\nSorry about my rant but i really like this game and devote quite some time into it. It has tons of flaws but i do believe all of them can be worked upon, its just that this situation is the tip of the iceberg for me and needed to let it out. (Sorry if this is a grammar/spelling nightmare im not english)\n\nTL;DR: Biggest clan in the server uses exploits to win every war. They are a known toxic community from other mmos, the way they behave should not go unpunished.",

This must be a bug i think personally and it has to be adressed or atleast aknowleged because its happened 4 times already for us in Cutlass, EBonscale, Restless and Weavers.

And when you go hiking it is very easy to distinguish what is meant to be there for navigation purposes, althought that is the one thing that i can sort of underdstand...

            "Sick",
            "No, without mods. Some stutter also happens and the gpu fans rank up.",
            "Nope",
            "The only thing that is giving me hope is that playing with graphics at minimum it doesnt happen. But u believe my specs shouls be able to handle this game...",
            "Yep i did use ddu and installed everything from scratch just to be sure. I dont use any mods either.",
            "I can start it up but after 1-2 minutes the game freezes and crashes. Gpu load seems to be very high also. I really like it and im just looking forward for the switch version because the steam one is unplayable.\n\nSpecs : I5 6600K GTX 1070, 16 Ram.",
            "People being slick af and then me failing to control the basics of movement.",
            "Damn i hope youre doing fine. I had a very bad time at one point playing cs but ive learned from it and its different now.",
            "Yea animal crossing is my go to now or skater xl. Its just doing your thing and theres no right or wrong way to do things.",
            "Hahah yess weed is good for that but it can go wrong if you start over using it and only relying on weed to be able to play. Now i only smoke before or after cause i over do it if I smoke during rounds. But yea that depends on the person a lot too. You habe to synergize with it.",
            "It is beautifull in a lot of ways. But you have to be in the right mood/mindset to play, thats for sure.",
            "Exactly. And you can learn to motivate people and have a good party/group. But yea as you said there are times that ita just better to mute them and move on. Sad but true.",
            "I couldnt have put it better. Most of the time althought we play team based games we still play like se are 5 individuals. Not 1 group.",
            "That is also true. You learn a lot of teamwork and you see how different people deal with different situations.",
            "Dont get me wrong, i am too and that is the problem, if i play a gamenlike valorant or cs go ill be focused on all the little sh** that happens and get stressed out because people dont take it serious so I have to be in a good mood in order play competitive.",
            "Exactly people want me to play dark souls or smash bros and man sometimes its just too much.",
            "I feel you on that. The thing is also i use to remember the toxic people which made me have a bad time.",
            "Ikr! But still i believe a lot of toxicity in those communities is due to tryharding.",
            "It really depends. When i come from work tired i put on some Dragon Quest or some minecraft just to relax and have no worries. Competitive gaming can burn you out a lot tho.",
            "Seems odd but Gamefreak is used to exactly that. Now thay they have plenty of room to work with its almost like they cant handle it.\n#BringBackSpritesforPokemon",
            "Hahah Chicote chicote... the thing is they exaggerate stuff like they will ask you to not clean the kitchen for a week and such to make it more dramatic. But usually the focus is on broken relationships or poorly managed restaurants.",
            "Lol",
            "Im my country its usually related to sports, football mostly.",
            "Yes",
            "Nice thanks for your help i do really appreciate it.",
            "The only thing im worried about is that i put the loctite on the nut not inside and then screw it. I had it already screwed in and put it on top and around. Will that work or should i re do it?",
            "Thanks a lot i did that. The thing is i dont have a nut that locks the king pin. Just the king pin. I put a drop on each. Should i wait 24h?\n\nEdit: I do have the nut and did that i confused some words. Thanks for the picture!",
            "No problem thanks for trying :D.",
            "My problem isnt the trucks with the board its the trucks itself the part with the wheels that falls off. The other half remains attached to the board.",
            "My firat time assembling a wooden board with trucks. The trucks i managed to put fairly well. But the truck itself keeps unmounting. And spliting. So any tips/tricks for that?",
            "Im still learning how to pop ollies so not for me.",
            "Omg man why did i laugh at this",
            "Yea man thats one of my thoughts. But grain of salt lets keep it calm xD",
            "My guesses are BLM or a hint to dark pokemon in colosseum/XD.",
            "Yes that is high on the list too.",
            "Might have to try that",
            "Yea I see it like this too. Maybe when dlcs are finally out or a bit before. But not next week.",
            "I want to be like you now.",
            "I dont see any possibility for gen 4 remakes. People need to chill xD",
            "Hmm I like to think they put things there for a reason so ill keep thinking about it.",
            "Can I use a tech deck to sand out a new applied grip tape? Got my first board but dont have any metal files around. Thanks!",
            "Interesting. Do you know why they made that one? Was it a promo for something?",
            "Ikr why no one talking about it? A hint for pokemon Colosseum/XD?",
            "Yes someone mentioned this and now im starting to get hype. I must keep calm...",
            "Black Pikachu too man. Wow dont hype me. This could happen.",
            "[removed]",
            "Sorry :/",
            "Pokemon XD",
            "Lets go jhotto next week. Those gen 2 starter plushies plus lugia ho oh and the dogs... with an eevee between umbreon and espeon.",
            "Yea thats why I think the reread might be gold. Ive only read the first prologue so far after every book. And just that is an awesome experience.",
            "Voted TWoK because it was a slow start for me but once i got into it it just got better and better. And i bet when i re read it i will like it even more.",
            "I mean technically speaking any character/power/splinter whatever that is in the Cosmere books is part of the Cosmere so yes. Most of the time without even knowing. Odium does know obviously.",
            "Oathbringer final spoilers >!When Renarin and Adolin talk in WoR and Renarin is looking at a horse thinking like \"this doesn't make any sense\" in terms of the creatures that exist in roshar a horse just doesn't fit in too well. Then I immediately thought yea right? And what about you? At that moment i realized humans where like the only ones in Roshar that were adapting buildings clothing etc ( external things to their anatomy) to protect themselves from highstorm. At that moment i told my friend \"Man what if humans are actually the voidbringers\" we just laughed it off and never mentioned it again. Then i read Oathbringer and was like WHAT THE ACTUAL F\\*\\*K. That was soo minblowing i cant put it into words.!"

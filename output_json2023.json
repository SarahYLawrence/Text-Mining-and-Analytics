There are a couple of cases where a person whose biological father left the person's mother during pregnancy meets their father after decades and begins a relationship. I don't see anything wrong with that. It gets more complicated if there was a parent-child relationship at some point.\\n\\nAbout the biohazard aspects of beastiality, necrophilia and cannibalism: there isn't much direct study on any of those for ethical reasons,  most of the studies that do exist are either based in other species or based in data gathered from known cases, almost none of which were in a controlled environment, so not very reliable. Also, it would depend a lot on the amount of people doing it.\\n\\nIt's very difficult to know whether there would be interspecies transmission of STDs if a lot of people started having sex with their dogs. It's not only uncommon for people to do that, it is also extremely unlikely that someone would admit to doing it, so there isn't much data about it. There's also the risk of infections that aren't STDs but are increased when you have sex with an animal bc of the contact of fluids.\\n\\nNecrophilia has the decomposition factor, so it isn't just a matter of diseases transmitted through the sex itself, there's also the risk of many other types of infections. Bodies start decomposing very quickly and it's not the same in every body.\\n\\n(I'm not mentioning the stuff about family bc that's way more complex and there's a whole debate about who should have the power over what happens to the body).\\n\\nCannibalism is probably the most problematic in terms of biohazard because diseases that spread through eating can become a really big problem really fast. All food industries have very strict regulations (meat even more so) so that food is safe to eat, and that's not possible if you're eating another human who had autonomy and lived their live in a not controlled environment. Many places don't even allow cattle to be fed any animal products bc of the risk of zoonosis. Human cannibalism is rare so there aren't many studies about the diseases one could get from eating human meat and/or internal organs.\\n\\nBoth cannibalism and necrophilia also have added risks depending on how much contact with the body the person doing those things has and some additional risks depending on whether the body has been embalmed (mostly for necrophilia, I don't think people that are into cannibalism would want to eat an embalmed body), how the person died, how much time has passed since the person died and many, many more things that increase or decrease the risk (and some might increase the risk at a personal level but decrease at a society level or vice versa). There's no way of knowing everything the person did in life and, well, you can't exactly ask a corpse whether they had any diseases. \\n\\nThere's also the thing about regulating all of this, which would be very difficult to do.\"",

Parents (in general, obviously there are exceptions) are authority figures to their children and they have a very significant influence in their children\\'s opinions, so there will always be *some* level of influence on the decision to have sex with them. \\n\\nWhen the incest is between siblings (or cousins or other \"same level\" relations), there can still be a power imbalance that is directly proportional to the difference in age and there\\'s the issue with the possibility of having children together (birth control can fail, condoms can break, so not necessarily intentionally having children) bc of recessive genetic disorders, but other than that it\\'s mostly cultural and in my opinion not *inherently* unethical (I think it\\'s weird af but not objectively unethical).\\n\\n\\nBestiality: again, imo there\\'s 2 categories. Female animals (or penetrating male animals) and being penetrated by a male animal.\\n\\nIn both categories the animal can\\'t consent, that\\'s already a reason for it to be unethical.\\n\\nThe first category also has the issue that not every animal can communicate pain, discomfort and things like that and can\\'t understand consequences.\\n\\nAlso, it\\'s unhygienic and has a lot of potential for interspecies transmission and generation of STDs, so it\\'s a huge biohazard.\\n\\n\\nNecrophilia (when consented before death): extremely unhygienic, potential biohazard in many ways but imo not inherently unethical in terms of the corpse itself (still unethical bc biohazard affects society)\\n\\n\\nCannibalism depends on if the person is alive or not. \\n\\nIf not alive (and not being killed for that specific reason) same issues as necrophilia \\n\\nIf alive there\\'s a whole ethical dilemma regarding one\\'s ability to consent to being killed or having pieces cut off.

Let's say one of the workers there saw that the handrails were destroyed, dismissed that information and decided to still climb the stairs, even though there were other possible routes, and got injured. It is clear you committed a crime. It is also clear that you are liable for the damage to the handrails. The injury is more complicated though, because you didn't force the worker to climb those stairs. Even if you are convicted in criminal court, civil court can rule that you are only liable for the handrails. \\n\\nAbout the evidence, both courts have to have evidence to make a decision. The only difference is that the criminal court has to have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (so anything that leaves a doubt results in not guilty) and the civil court has to have evidence enough that the possibility that you caused the damage is greater than the possibility that you didn't (so a 90% certainty wouldn't impede a ruling in favor of the person being sued)\"",

More traditional Orthodox women likely wont wear trousers, will cover their hair after marriage but probably wont shave it off, and gay folks would not be accepted. In Ultra Orthodox communities, women shave their heads and wear wigs or coverings.

But they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t performing any solo surgery and they function in a midlevel capacity, ie primarily as data gatherers who help triage and expedite patient care. The final recs still come from the surgeon. \\n\\nMost of the CRNAs I know make me nervous, because most of them entered the field: to get away from bedside nursing, to have more independence, and to make more money. Compare that to an anesthesiologist, who chose the specialty because they enjoy  excel at procedural physiology at a very advanced level. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not the same. \\n\\nSimilarly, the whole \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou can change specialties whenever you want\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thing - well in my mind that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a good thing. Each specialty requires specific training to be minimally competent. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good reason that I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just decide I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a cardiologist and open a practice tomorrow. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seen as acceptable/a benefit that a midlevels can move between specialties without any kind of accreditation or proof of appropriate supervision.

Clearly, not all undertreated women end up with a diagnosis of SSD, so you need to account for that difference if you want your issue with the diagnosis itself to be taken seriously. \\n\\nAs a final point, I now have one (1) year as a doctor and I feel comfortable saying some people absolutely have a psychiatric disorder relating to their health, and most of them are adamant that psychiatric treatment won\\'t help them.

It started as a high-pitched ringing in my right ear but after a month or so the left started doing it too. The right is more constant but pretty quiet; the left is usually louder but sometimes stops completely. I spoke to my Dr who assumed it was wax so I tried using drops but nothing happened. Got my ears checked and they were clear of wax and my hearing is fine. Spoke to Dr again and asked to change my medication (sertraline) as tinnitus can be a side effect of it but I'm now 3 weeks into a different one and it hasn't made any difference.  \\n\\n\\nI just have no idea why it's happening to me as I don't listen to loud music, don't work in construction, very rarely go to clubs and am not a big concert-goer.

It wants SMS verification. Nothing came through using my number, presumably because it\\'s a UK and not a Korean number, even with the country code +44 at the start.

In most normal situation that doesn\\'t really affect me, I wear what I want to each day, whether that is a deepcut shirt with hotpants or an oversized hoodie and long jeans.

This lead to me constantly trying to look as non-sexual as possible when playing/practicing, which includes having my (kinda long) hair in a braid instead of a ponytail, always wearing long leggings and having my sport shirt (idk the name in English, the one that everybody from a team has, with their number and name on it) be multiple sizes too big so that it doesn\\'t show my body as much. \\n\\n\\nWe have two coaches, coach A who isn\\'t present a lot, mostly just comes with us on competitions and is pretty nice and coach B, who has practice with most times and is rather strict, even though he gives good feedback. But something about him always freaked me out, I just feel like he\\'s treating me different than the most girls (even though there aren\\'t many other girls to begin with). He\\'s called me \"bitch\" multiple times to my face, I think it just slipped out of him the first time, but he still didn\\'t apologise and the other times, he didn\\'t say anything but even laughed as if it was a funny joke. Remember, I\\'m 16 (15 when it first happened) and this guy is in his mid or late 50s. Today, we had to do an exercise where we had to be in push-up position but then \"jump\" with our legs while not having our arms leave our position. While explaining it, he mentioned multiple times that we must not relax our lower body (butt and legs) for even a second for this exercise to be effective, which is a fairly normal comment to make. However, when it was our turn to do it, he went around and watched everybody, but only stopped when he got to me. I wasn\\'t the best at it, sure, but I definitely did decent. However, he made a whole point out of coming up next to me, touching my back, saying \"this is okay, right?\" And then, without waiting for an answer, moving his hand down to my butt, kinda just resting it there for a second and saying \"you\\'re too relaxed, you can\\'t relax it like that\". Then he let go of me and continued to go to the next person. It just freaked me out that this grown ass man would randomly touch my butt like that, especially without properly asking. There were about ten other people around and he made no effort to hide it, which kinda makes me question whether I\\'m overreacting??

After that we became friends again and we didn't really have anything romantic going on and we would have sex very very very sporadically. There were no romantic feelings though.\\n\\nAs mentally ill people, we both appreciate it having someone that understands what it's like to suffer from this sort of conditions. He has expressed how much he appreciates me and my friendship multiple times.\\n\\nHowever in the past month he has told me that he now has a girlfriend. I completely understood and of course wasn't going to engage in sexual activities with him anymore. He told me that he wanted to still be friends and that it would be okay and that he appreciates me.\\n\\nAnyway time went on and it seems that this girlfriend is not comfortable with us being friends and she has made it clear to Fernando that she's not happy that he has me as a friend given the fact that I'm his ex. He told me that and I sort of insisted that he should be able to make his own choices and that she should understand and trust him. He thought about it and said that what I was saying was reasonable and then then we could continue to be friends.\\n\\nHowever today he has texted me that he needs to distance himself from me because her girlfriend doesn't want us to be friends anymore and that it is his priority to keep his girlfriend.\\n\\nOf course, I think I deeply believe that this is wrong and that a good person who loves you will not try to limit who your friends are no matter what especially since you're promising that nothing's going to happen.

I am very lost at this point.\\n\\n\\nTLDR: my friend with whom I had a short relationship has a new girlfriend and she doesn't want him to have any contact with me because of our history.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exhilarating even. Of course we know as a common sense that scratching an itch would probably revive it and make it worse, but I noticed the moment of satiation whenever such topics were brought up, and then followed by more overwhelming urges that I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really describe (like yay ahahaaahaha now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scratch that skin to the bones!).\\n\\nSo I saw in these reactions how deeply I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m identifying with the troubled part of me, and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do me no good.

I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve outgrown that history, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m indeed getting stronger, why, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m writing an ad looking for partner now, you bet I want some good things in life.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what else is looking bad on me\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.

But still, German is a beautiful language! I began by reading Kafka\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ein Landarzt, which has been my favorite for years, then I ventured to read Also sprach Zarathustra which was such a pleasure at first, until Zarathustra spoke of going to women with a whip. Why, if Nietzsche had the fame of the great misogynist like Schopenhauer did, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be as much disappointed, but most people only know him as the mad guy crying for a dead horse which makes his profile kind of loving. I actually cried like a broken hearted lover, why Zarathustra why, I love your teachings so much and you only want to whip me???

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m kind of a daredevil at times (which means when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not too lazy to move), and enjoy doing dangerous or unusual things just for the fun of it. I went to visit the cemetery at night because I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep, made a ladder myself from shelves and chair to climb into my dorm window on the second floor when I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have keys, and I can ride a bike with hands off! Ah those are happy moments!\\n\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure which city I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be in after I graduate, hopefully I find a job in Europe, hopefully.\\n\\nWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking for is some serious, long-term relationship. I know you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t push such things and serious commitments are intimidating, but I speak of the ideal case scenario, and maybe in a very long time. What I forgot to mention above is that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also extremely introvert, I have no friends in life, barely some acquaintances, because most times I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just keep to myself, how could you expect to make friends like that? But really, social with people even people you like is exhausting. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if the metaphor is inappropriate but my want for long committed relationship is kind of like choosing good tv series (once chosen you get to watch for months even years) over good films, I want company and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the trying and choosing period, I want to find someone and stick to the choice.\\n\\nWell I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really say what I expect in you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 basically anyone who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still reading here, and is interested, or have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.",
            "\"oh no!!... please hear me out. What I did was a part-time job, when I was still in college. So if the issue is not obvious....why didn't my employer have an interpretor that works just for him? Because he don't need one, best option for him was to hire one from local college just for the occasion. So as many employers. The issue is, interpreting occasions are relatively rare, especially with the covid. So either I work freelance with is highly unstable and, I have to say, very stressing because you're like constantly job hunting, especially as a beginner, I don't think I can handle that. Either some bigger companys do hire interpretors, I actually worked at some of them, and what I found out was, 'interpretor' is just a job title for them, what you really do is a lot of administrative work, and interpret when in need, so it's a hell of difference from what I did as a student, suppose I look for sth like what I enjoyed\\\\* 24days a month, such thing I don't think even exist.

            "\"Hi, definitely can use some career advice here. I'm going to graduate in 2023 with MA in French language and literature. I've been thinking a lot on what I'm going to do and what I know for sure is that I hate teaching (as much as I suck at it so no regrets), and that I'm a horrible, horrible procrastinator (I basically can never meet the deadline for my assignments and such behavior hardly changed no matter how bad the consequenses). I also believed for a long time that I'd better look for less people interactions because I'm extremely introvert, easily stressed and have a history with really bad mental problems. So I thought there could be literally no possible job at all for me.  \\n\\nLately though my mind has changed. I realized that my true stressor does not come from the outside world, and it's certainly not interaction with people that I fear. Actually I get the worst anxiety when I'm forcing myself to do the work that I (God knows why) procrastinate... I think maybe I'm just bad at work that are assigned to me with a deadline, and I be the master of my time in between as long as I get the work done is my nightmare scenario. On the contrary if there's no time in between, if what the work requires is instant reaction and even improvisation, I think I can do just fine. I remember on my last year in college I worked for two weeks as an interpretor in some florists seminar, and I actually enjoyed it. Now there are much fewer occasions as such due to the covid, but I think maybe there are similar jobs? No or very little assignements, lots of field work instead of sitting in the office? I really can't think of many jobs like this, God I know so little of what are the jobs out there in the world! Any suggestions please?\"",

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on and off meds for years. Recently started lexapro again and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really helpful. I experience the same thing where I ruminate on a conversation/reaction and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop thinking about what happened and how it could have been different or what I did wrong. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m starting therapy again to help with these thoughts and to see if there are reasons why I have these social anxieties and how to be more mindful. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough. But just recognizing it is a great start! Maybe talk to your doc about meds, and if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasible try therapy too!",

Everyone has different triggers, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do some simple ones: \\n\\n- be mindful of mentioning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunhealthy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d foods. for one, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no such thing, for two, it puts an unnecessary stigma on certain types of food choices that someone recovering doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need. \\n- do not comment on your friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body. it might be changing, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay! that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also good.\\n- try to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweight talk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, be it someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body changing (a friend, a parent trying weight loss, etc) or the time your doctor weighed you. weight is stressful (and does not correlate with your health, BMI is a lie!) and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be blabbed about. it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally like. the least interesting thing to talk about. \\n- do not ask direct questions regarding treatment (!!unless your friend brings it up first!!) keep things light unless she invites the conversation. treatment is uncomfortable, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raw and tiring. if she brings up passing stories, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool! things like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9c or \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow is recovery going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9c can be overwhelming. \\n\\nand- if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re close enough- ask your friend how you can support her. i think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s particularly hard being asked what you need, but treatment centers do prepare you on average for Knowing things. she might want distracting conversations during meal times. she might want space. she might want someone to talk to, who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold her with kid gloves. there are easily things that are harder for her to deal with i didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention- she might ask to not bring up certain foods or health talk, or even just things that seem weird. she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask if it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. \\n\\nas a final note, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a friend, not a counselor. know your boundaries and emotional bandwidth. your friend likely (hopefully) has a team of professionals wiling to talk out the tough stuff. she cares about you too. treat her as you always do, tell her you love her and you support her- give a hug, if she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like one. take care of yourself first, and the rest can come with it. \\n\\nbest of luck.",
            "I had issues long before I developed an eating disorder. Things started simple with like, guilt around food. I saw my sibling go through some cycle of disordered eating, and my parents commented on their own bodies a lot. While my sister seemed to gotten better since then, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget it. I have memories around 17-19 binging and purging, yet I still had very\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I dunno, times when I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t focused on my body at all. When I was fine. \\n\\nWhen I hit university I went to the gym more often than I ever had. Then I had a professor talk about committing to my values, and I changed my food lifestyle for good. Which exacerbated my long dormant cycle of guilt surrounding food. I kept at it for about 3 years before I sought ED treatment on my own volition.\\n\\nI only label this all out to say, I was lucky. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have family members commenting on my body. I had peripherally disordered eating habits and mindsets, but I later came into my eating disorder on my own. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that picky as a kid. Prior to my dietary restrictions, I really had an expansive palate willing to try everything at least once. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still gaining that back.

Via a doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment for this singular GI issue, or something more focused on the core problems at hand if you are able to seek any sort of treatment.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so proud of you!\\n\\nI will say what my dietician told me in treatment: Things scream louder when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dying. \\n\\nYour ED is seeing your drive and intentional recovery, and that can lead to thinks like symptom swapping (I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel the urge to binge until I kept myself from other behaviors, for instance) or these hard spikes in urges. But behaviors don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been doing the right thing. \\n\\nRecovery is really really hard. I really feel you on that. But I also know that every time you complete a meal, or mindfully partake, or fend off the urge for five extra minutes or ten or a whole evening- you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re beating your ED. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold does get less, and these spikes get less frequent.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also totally natural to feel these maladaptive coping skills come up with things going on in your life. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve served you in the past, they just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t serve you now. Keep doing what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.

            "When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m committing to recovery like I have been, I find it takes all my energy and focus, just like my ED does.

I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t write or draw. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t focus or read. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too focused on the moment to moment to reach outside of my ED OR my recovery. \\n\\nI know this is necessary. I know this is the path to getting better (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it before, I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible) but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy with it.

If I want my life back (I do, I do) I have to give it just a little bit more. A bit longer. \\n\\nI just wanted to know if anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s felt this too. \\n\\nFor those who need some hope: it gets easier. Step by step, over time.

I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard. I definitely second something small (I usually suggest something softer on the stomach like soup) and finding someone/something to distract yourself. Watch a movie with someone. Even stay in the same space together, call a friend, watch a youtube video.

Been on T for 5 years and I still have to pull teeth to get that prescription renewed (often in person appointments that I called for 3 weeks to get an answer, any answer. Leaving a message leads me nowhere.) There are two PPs in my immediate area and both are like this. Just a lot of demand and not enough support. And doctors in my area were super transphobic and unwilling, they were my only lifeline which I am grateful for- but they do do this unfortunately.\\n\\nTLDR: More doctors will be more comfortable prescribing HRT after you get established to the best of my knowledge.

Like the other day I was switching the oxygen over to the non-rebreather and I couldn\\'t remember what plugged in where, so I asked and the vet snapped at me, \"I showed you this the other day.\" Like yeah, I know, but I\\'m trying to learn 100 things a minute and I\\'m not a perfect person. I get scolded, snapped at, eye rolls all day long. I\\'ve cried multiple times at work out of frustration.\\n\\nAnd I know I\\'m the new person, but the amount of shit work I get is so upsetting. God forbid someone else clean diarrhea. I spend so much of my day cleaning kennels, doing laundry, mopping, doing dishes. No one else helps with that stuff. Which would be fine if that was like, my job description, but I had no job description, I have no job title, and I don\\'t have any official set of responsibilities. I know saying this is like very entitled but like why did I go to four years of school to mop floors?\\n\\nFinally, the people at my job seem like they don\\'t even like animals. Actually, one of the head techs told me on my second day that she doesn\\'t like any animals. No one seems to have any kind of emotional connection to the animals, and they are all so rough with them in ways that sometimes seem appalling. Like, if a dog is freaking out about a nail trim, they will scream at him \"STOP\" and then throw him on the floor and pin him. I know this can sometimes be necessary but it happens so often. Also, everyone has no tolerance for dogs barking and freaks out when they bark for more than a minute. The loudest dogs get put in a cage alone in the basement, and no one checks on them all day. We board dogs frequently and one of our boarders was a barker, so she stayed in the basement for the week she was there, only getting out four times a day to pee. Like isn\\'t that... animal cruelty? Am I being excessively sensitive?\\n\\nIs this normal? I feel totally miserable. I hate every second. I find myself jealous of people at literally any other job, from lifeguards to gas station attendants, because they don\\'t have to deal with this. Am I being dramatic? Can anyone relate?",

            "Recently there has been a [bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfO0dvqI9B4) by Jordan Peterson on the Lex Fridman show on depression, where Jordan lays out the path to overcoming depression: making things marginally better by adopting habits that you can actually manage to reliably adopt: can\\'t get out of bed? sit up; can\\'t sit up? prop yourself on your elbows at least once. the point is to make things so easy that you will actually do them and part of this is taking away the decision making aspect of them. As someone who has been in a repeated battle with depression this rings particularly true to me, and it is the way I patch myself up once I have a story to tell myself again, which is quite the issue on its own.\\n\\nIt is generally known that conscientiousness increases (on average) with age. one way to interpret this, is that it is something that \"just happens\". Another is that as people progress in their lives they might get thrown new responsibilities to take care of, which forces them to adapt their behavior to keep up or give up, where the latter is not always feasible (in case of not being able to afford or want getting fired, or having to take care of children). it doesn\\'t mean everyone will do this, but such situations provide an impetus which can make this happen.\\n\\nif-then rules; I forgot how I came across the paper, but I\\'ve recently read a bunch of papers on behavior/personality change [one](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10253/97GollBrand_ImpIntGoalPurs.pdf?sequence=1=y) [two](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-13967-001) [three](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2017548118), out of which the bottom line seems to be thinking up if-then rules helps the formation of habits because it removes the otherwise necessary moment-to-moment decision making process making it easier to actually do things vs just wanting to do things without a clear how.\\n\\nI\\'m incredibly bad at policing myself (and an incredible sucker for novelty vs.. sticking to a plan) if I consciously try to do it, but these are things I notice have an effect on me.\\n\\nComing back to the story issue - the \"who am I and why am I even doing this?\" - For me it\\'s quite difficult to maintain a consistent interest in stories, so much so that I can spend 2 months reading the Deep Work book ([podcast section core idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJYlhhT7hyE)) from Cal Newport, implement a bunch of things form it, and then fall back a bunch of steps because my mind becomes preoccupied with different things.\\n\\nThe main Issue, I think I at least face, is that if things do not work out the way you think, and that thinking was connect to a story, then the story weakens in influence because you discover it isn\\'t as good a story as you thought it was. But if the story was the thing pushing you forward you now have less of a push overall resulting in a downward spiral. One way to remedy this is by replacing the story with peoples feedback, but this is only as productive as the people around you are helpful or desirable to emulate. Another is taking up a religion earnestly, since the \\'solution\\' to experiencing problems is asking god for help and guidance, rather than dropping the religion outright, but this is easier said than done.\\n\\nI don\\'t know you, so I have no idea to what extend your low conscientiousness claim about yourself is actually true, versus being self-critical. (you put in the effort to paragraph  bullet-point your post for example, so it can\\'t be bottomless-pit low at least), but regardless I would think it\\'s a bad idea to conceptualize yourself as low conscientiousness instead of as someone who has not learned to act conscientiously effectively, and that that is something worth learning so you can execute corresponding behavior when \"just acting conscientiously\" *is* the lazy solution (e.g. when doing a repetitive task).",
            "\"depends how you define success: people considering themselves to be part of a tribe, or amount of actual change caused by the movement. If there is little aesthetic, which might have seduced people into the movement, then there is less dispersion of interest from the foundations among people who have joined the movement.\\n\\nTo give an example: As a university student I have seen quite some people who clamored about their socialist, communist or anarchist beliefs; while contributing little to such groups besides joining parties. At the same time I know a few effective altruists, who were almost all very much involved in organising public lectures, meetups, starting companies even. All had very bland style, as opposed to the other group (with the most style-conscious person among EA's being least involved in making things/organisation).\\n\\nI do admit there might be a bias in self-proclamation here - who would call themselves an effective altruist publicly if they're not actually being effective?\\n\\nJust because you as a writer feel not as compelled to join because of an aesthetic lack does not mean it is not doing its job; low aesthetic might be a filter for people who look at the bottom line, rather than intermediate aspects/substitute goals. Art/aesthetics becomes important for movements if their goals are to gain adherents  come to rule through social expectations. It seems to me the EA have less of a desire for ruling (since it requires time spent doing non-goal activities, is slow/inefficient and unnecessary for many goals) since it cares less about other people doing things in particular ways than it cares about them being able to do things at all.\\n\\nEven as a symmetric weapon analogy it does not work; EA  related groups are not in conflict for adherents, they acknowledge that although there are issues that are Incredibly Important, they also acknowledge that there are many such issues which are not even known yet, and discovering unknown unknown systemic risk is one of their directions of interest. As such, the least amount of aesthetic might well be a coordination point since it signifies the group which is actually doing it for the goals they profess, rather than a secondary goal. \\n\\nAt the same time, EA's low focus on aesthetics has a similar thing going as minimalism, which although not calling for followers somehow seems to get them, and what is the purpose in telling minimalists to not be minimalist if it seems to work for them?\\n\\nThe counterpoint about it's communication style is pretty strong, so much so that I recognize a similar appreciation when I read some pieces, e.g. from SSC/ACX/Gwern as when I do a novel with particular style; clear writing, with elaborations and interesting details, but without them ever feeling like they have been written for their own sake, flowing naturally through the text as if they belong.\\n\\nIf an aesthetic truly is necessary and people are looking for one; [Terrapunk](https://nasjaq.substack.com/p/the-terrapunk-manifesto) aligns closest I think\\n\\nEdit: an example of such small textual additions is in the tagline of ACX:\\n> P(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\\n\\nIf all the rest is commentary, then why bother writing that? - It looks nice, and makes for a more interesting read; just because it is commentary does not mean it is of no value.

            "Firstly I wouldn\\'t say at all that we are far away from general intelligence. Personally, I think your view of \"just\" bridging the gap between \"CNNs\" (aka visual processing) and \"symbol manipulation\" aka literally every other part of intelligence is overly simplistic and doesn\\'t capture what is difficult about the problem. Connecting CNNS and symbol manipulation will not result in general intelligence, CNNs are flawed in many ways and very different from human visual systems, and symbol manipulation like GPT-3 does is not going to become qualitatively different when connected with visual input and sensation, but that\\'s besides the point.\\n\\nThe problem with your argument is that you have made a fundamental assumption that paperclip maximisers and stamp collectors are \"obviously not general intelligences\". Well, why not? What is general intelligence? I\\'d say it\\'s the ability to achieve your goals in a wide range of complex environments. You should research the orthogonality thesis, it shows that the goals an agent pursues, and the intelligence of the agent are orthogonal, aka completely unrelated. I can easily imagine a superintelligent paperclip maximiser which can use its general intelligence to manipulate people and craft complicated multi-sequence plans in order to achieve its goals extremely well. I would call that generally intelligent. There is no law that says AI becomes more human if we just make it smarter, it only just becomes more effective at realising its goals\\n\\nThe paperclip discussion is extremely important because we\\'re talking about theory that we can directly prove and take into account when designing AI systems. For example, here is a long (and growing) list of AI systems ([https://t.co/No73R9GYdO](https://t.co/No73R9GYdO)) which were explicitly programmed with one goal, but ended up \"reward hacking\" to do something unexpected to get a higher reward. This is literally something we can test and observe and can be absolutely catastrophic if the AI becomes more capable of utilising its intelligence to fool us and gain power because of a poorly specified reward function. Also, note that any AI will exhibit this behaviour because of instrumental convergence. All AIs will attempt to gain resources, and exhibit self-improvement and self-preservation because those goals are instrumental to every possible goal an AI could have. Its an ongoing and extremely challenging problem to design systems which are \"corrigible\" and allow us to turn them off and adapt to our needs because if an AI is poorly specified, it would rather kill everyone before changing its goals.",

If one wishes to argue, however, that it was a case of externally forced linear resonance, the mathematical distinction between Eqs.

Now as to why we see near instant switching between two states: even though they look stable they are actually unstable points, it just takes a long time for the switch to build up. Since the nut is not spinning on a major/minor axis, little rotations not in the main rotation axis affects the main rotation: stealing some angular momentum and energy (this is allowed because we are not on a major/minor axis therefore there are states nearby with the same total angular momentum and energy), the more angular momentum that gets stolen the quicker the stealing happens, once half way through the switching  the balance shifts and the stealing becomes giving until there is no more angular momentum in the non main spinning axes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all a very dynamic process, the motion from the last step affecting the motion in the next step while spinning in multiple axes all coming together whilst conserving angular momentum.\\n\\nA slightly different but analogous example is imagine a simple pendulum attached to a point with a solid rod. If the pendulum is balanced upside down perfectly it will stay there forever without starting to swing. Now if a single spec of dust hits the pendulum imparting a tiny amount of force; the pendulum will seem to stay in place but actually is slightly unbalanced, overtime it will get pulled more and more downward, quicker and quicker until it begins to visibly swing. It will swing down and around and right back up to the seemingly stable upside down state; gravity slowly but exponentially amplified the instability created by the dust and switches the pendulum from one semi-stable state to the next. In the spinning nut example the two pendulum states are the two semi-stable spinning states and the gravity that caused the state switching is a complicated interplay between the possible spinning axes of the nut and conservation of angular momentum + energy.

            "> But I think that other, surrounding areas of the flag will have had similar amounts of force acting on them, so they all moved together. It was only the bottom-right corner of the flag that moved. \\n\\nWhile yes they will feel similar forces, they will not all feel forces in the same direction, the forces will be radial outwards from the astronaut, so the effective turning forces will not be evenly distributed. This difference in turning forces will cause the dragging I mentioned and also dissipate energy in the form compression of the material, ripples in the fabric and heat formation.\\n\\n> Do you know how I could do this for, say, the bottom-right corner of the flag? \\n\\nWell, the thing about moments of inertia is they are dependant on the total geometry of the object in question. You are on the right track by thinking of just one segment but what moments of inertia allow us to do is take into consideration all these minute pieces of fabric and how they interact with one another, the moment of inertia is defined by summing distribution of all infinitesimal pieces of mass so one can consider all of the object instead of just a corner. (Although intuitively I see where you are coming from, rotational dynamics can be unintuitive and your calculation/model is very very simplistic and runs the risk of being a very bad estimation of the total motion) Using the moment of inertia and the force \"profile\" on the flag one can determine how the flag shall move as a whole.\\n\\n> To be honest, I just want to be able to say that it\\'s at least possible that static force moved the flag. \\n\\nOh, there most definitely was a contribution from the static force, the reality is our models are just that, models, all of the possible reasons for the motion described in your source contributed something to the motion of the flag, not just 1 singular thing. But the thing about physics and analyzing phenomena is that most of these contributions can be seen as negligible compared to one or two of the main driving forces in play, physicists often use their intuition and \"back of the envelope\" calculations to try to determine what could have realistically been the main cause (Although in this case maybe they did run many different scenarios computationally to determine the conditions required for each scenario). In your source they say \"not likely\", this doesn\\'t mean that there was no static force or that the static force did not cause the motion but that the circumstances in which the static forces were the main contribution (having a 10kV potential difference between the hand and flag for example) is unlikely compared to other options.",
            "A few things about your general calculations/concepts that I feel would need working on in order to make a full model that I got by skimming your post:\\n\\n>it\\'s just necessary (I think) to divide this impulse by the mass of the small flag section to find the velocity in meters per second that the flag section would end up with.\\n\\nThis ignores the fact that the flag is one large solid object, while yes if it was just this small segment taking the entire force it would end with a velocity similar to what you calculated given your assumptions we must take into consideration that the flag segment\\'s motion is being dampened and impeded by the fact that it is \"dragging\" the rest of the flag with it. In order to get a full model of the motion one would need to take into account the dynamics of the flag as a whole, this impulse would propagate and dissipate throughout the entire flag and not just the singular segment which gives much different final velocities/dynamic profile of what\\'s going on.\\n\\nA better simplistic model one could try using is assuming the flag is a rigid cuboid which can only rotate about the flag pole axis. One can then say that the flag acts as a rigid rod with some spring/restoring force which tries to pull the flag back to its natural resting position (not sure how one would find such a constant simply other than through empirical testing or more advanced 3d simulations of the flag) and the electromagnetic force felt at every segment of the flag. While I do like your idea use of impulses, when it comes to more complicated dynamic systems like this one would probably have to use green\\'s functions to calculate the motion after applying the impulses, it\\'s probably easier to calculate the total energy that the electric force applies and convert it all to rotational energy in this model. By doing this one can calculate the rotational velocity of the flag for any given moment in time (the full dynamics of this simple flag system).\\n\\n>In the moon\\'s gravity 249 grams would be 41.17 grams.\\n\\nMass is a body\\'s tendency to resist motion, this is irrelevant of what planet you are on, the only thing that changes on different planets is the gravitational acceleration felt not the mass of the object so a flag which is 249 grams on earth is 249 grams on the moon and 249 grams on Jupiter etc. as the flag is still made of the same amount of \"stuff\" which is what gives it its mass, things in space don\\'t lose their mass because there is no gravitational body around, they will still be \"resistant\" to other types of forces which is what mass is. If one was to use the primitive model I described above you would need to calculate the flags moment of inertia which is the rotational analogue to mass, an object\\'s \"resistance\" to rotation/torques.\\n\\n\u200b\\n\\nBut overall I find it unlikely that the static electricity is the cause and the other options outlined in the journal you linked are more likely just due to one fact: the energy that an electric field can exchange at such distances and at such a scale is minuscule compared to the energy it takes to make a 250g flag swing as shown in the video, at least that\\'s what my intuition from working in physics for many years is telling me without doing the calculations explicitly.",

My hot flashes are better when I take it.\\n\\nTurmeric (Meriva by Thorne) - this is as powerful an anti-inflammatory as NSAIDs for me. Meriva is the gold standard for turmeric supplements- it's what they use in studies of the benefits of turmeric. I can't take NSAIDs because of my medications, so this is what I take.\\n\\nQuerticin - it helps with pain brought on by low estrogen. It has to build up in the system I've found and doesn't work well if I take it inconsistently.\\n\\nMagnesium glycinate - I think that's what it's called? Magnesium helps with muscle stiffness and pain. If you're waking up with cramping calves in the middle of the night, you need this. \\n\\nVitamin D - I had my kids in my late 30s and breast fed well into my 40s. I had my blood levels checked because of extreme fatigue and I was pathologically low so now I supplement. It helps. \\n\\nVitamin B complex - as we age, our bodies don't hold on to B vitamins as well and don't extract them from food as efficiently. Good for brain fog and fatigue\\n\\nIron - have your ferritin levels checked in addition to your regular iron  levels. Anemia is more common in older women and low iron contributes to the brain fog/fatigue.\\n\\nHope that helps. Sorry for the novel.\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot a supplement, lol. Also added spacing.\\n\\nCollagen - we don't produce as much naturally after estrogen declines, and the lack of collagen makes tendons more brittle and prone to injury as well as causing skin to sag and appear older. This helps. My supplement contains hyaluronic acid, which makes tissues more juicy and resilient, too.\"",

The house had even been declared a landmark by the state, with a plaque that claimed the house had been built in 1640.\\nThe summer when I was 10 years old, I stayed with my grandparents, whose property was adjacent to my Great Aunt I.I.\\'s. It was about a quarter mile hike to get to her house from theirs. \\n\\nI.I. invited me to stay the night with her one time but she warned me that she had a ghost in her upstairs who LOVED children, so I was likely to get a visit. I thought she was messing with my head and didn\\'t think much of it. \\n\\nShe set me up in one of her upstairs guest rooms, just down the hall from her bedroom. I had settled in and gone to sleep. Deep in the night, I have no idea what time, I awoke to a soft glow in the hallway under the door of my room and the sound of soft footfalls creaking in the hall outside. At first I thought it was my aunt, but the steps kept pacing back and forth and the soft glow was moving with the footsteps, up and down the hall. I began to get nervous, rembering I.I.\\'s warning about the ghost. I turned over in bed so that I couldn\\'t see the moving glow in the hall and looked out the window next to my bed, trying to ignore the footsteps and fell asleep again. \\n\\nA while later, I awoke to my bedroom door creaking open and my room was lit by that soft glow, like someone had come in carrying a candle. I felt a cold chill on my back and tensed up with fear, shutting my eyes tight. I feel a gentle hand begin to stroke my hair away from my face. I thought maybe it was I.I. so I open my eyes and look around. The room is lit with the candlelight glow, but there is no visible source. I lay back down, eyes squeezed shut tight. The sensation of the hand stroking my head comes back and I hear a gentle, \"shhhh.\" Then I feel a soft kiss on my forehead and I was filled with this deep sense of love and peace. The glow left the room and I was able to fall asleep right away. \\n\\nI stayed over with I.I. a couple of other times during that summer and would hear the footsteps in the hall and see the soft glow that went with them in the hall each time, but she never came into my room again, that I was aware of.

The mixed use shopping complex I work in was built on old Mental Health State Services land and they had to move a few graves from a little cemetary that was on the property to build the shopping center. \\nVariations of this have happened throughout the 10 years I've worked there: lights switching off mid session, the ceiling fan turning off, etc. We all joke about out resident ghost. \\nSo I'm in the middle of a massage, (thankfully the client was face down during the activity) when the ceiling fan clicks up to its highest setting. It's going faster than I've ever seen it go. My hands are on the client, so I had no way to accidentally change the speed. Suddenly the fan stops dead like someone stopped it with their hand. It doesn't slow down, just goes from full tilt boogie to an standstill instantly. Then it starts going in the opposite direction just as fast as before. I'm trying to not let the client be aware of how much I'm freaking out. They tell me they're cold which gives me an excuse to shut off the fan completely. The lights flicker once after this, then things are back to normal.\\nNow, these fans do have remotes, which could explain the speed change, I guess. But the only way to switch the direction of rotation is via a switch on the housing of the motor. And when you turn the speed down, it doesn't stop immediately. It slowly loses momentum. I can't explain the abrupt stop and change in direction. \\nSo, that's my experience with the clinic ghost. \\nA colleague of mine told me they had a similar experience in that room and the client witnessed it and stopped the session then and there.

            " My name is Luz Noceda. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Gravesfield, USA, 87104. This is my confession. If you\\'re watching this tape, I\\'m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Edric Blight. Ed has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 32th birthday, Ed came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my glyph knowledge to cook illegal fireworks, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the Emperor\\'s Coven. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Ed was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a palisman diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Ed took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small fireworks operation could make. And I was weak. I didn\\'t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Ed had a partner, a man named Augustus Porter, a businessman. Ed essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Porter threatened my family. I didn\\'t know where to turn. Eventually, Ed and Porter had a falling out. From what I can gather, Ed was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Porter flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Porter was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Ed was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177,000 snails. Upon recovery, Ed was bent on revenge, working with a witch named Edalyn Clawthorne, he plotted to kill Porter, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I\\'m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Ed had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Gravesfield DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Ed had taken our children. We were scared. I was in the bad place, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can\\'t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Ed will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",

Make it seem as real as possible in your head. Basically trigger a panic attack. And then try to find mental or physical coping skills to bring me back to baseline/calm. This way I learned how to best calm my anxiety in a controlled environment before going on longer exposures. I put together a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmental toolbox\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of coping skills for myself.

And I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where a lot of people stagnate. Or they never figure out what the underlying panic is from. Like what are you scared of? Cause it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not outside. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scenario that plays in your head when you feel that fear. Work through it in a safe place, trigger it like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re experiencing it in a safe environment and learn to sit with it comfortably. Mine was fear of passing out or a health emergency. So I kept doing stuff while I felt those symptoms like dizziness and eventually I learned that no matter what I am in control of the situation. I may feel dizzy but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to die or get sick. And remember: you can always go back. You are never trapped. You are capable and you can trust your body to look out for you. These are the ideas that got me through the panic. Sometimes I would pull over and take a second to calm myself, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. The main thing is you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still doing the exposure.",
            "In the beginning, I used to take a water bottle with me everywhere. I would sip the cold water and fidget with the cap to distract myself.

Eventually I was able to get rid of the water bottle but it helped a lot. I had to really learn breathing exercises (they had never helped in the past until I did it right), sometimes I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll flap my hands to let the anxiety out or go for a walk to get some of the stagnant anxiety out. Cold water sips also help with nausea so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good method.",

            "Exposure therapy and medication, plus addressing cognitive distortions that I would use to justify staying in or cause me more panic. \\n\\nI would say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s both. While some exposures required me to just rip the bandaid off, I also did smaller exposures in the beginning until I felt more confident in myself. For example, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be home alone or shower alone in the beginning my agoraphobia was so severe. So I started by showering alone repeatedly to get used to that. Eventually I felt strong enough to drive a massive trigger road by myself. \\n\\nAbsolutely set backs and I still have it sometimes where my brain fights me. It tells me to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstay in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. I just tell myself I am not going to allow myself to be back in the miserable place I started. I let myself have my anxiety but refuse to let it stop me now. I will just tell someone \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m being weird, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having a panic attack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d instead of hiding it. \\n\\nFor me, panic attacks themselves. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had panic attacks since I was around 5-6 years old. But the fear kept me in my agoraphobia. I had to restructure myself to embrace the panic attack (which is very very difficult) and to learn to sit with discomfort rather than run. I would reassure myself panic attacks cannot kill you or cause serious damage and they ALWAYS have to end at some point. It cannot last forever, your body just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sustain that. \\n\\nI do still have symptoms but I would still consider myself recovered. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recovered in the past and symptoms have totally disappeared for years so I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible but I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still early on and I need to earn my secure attachment to the outer world for a bit longer. After 2-4 years, I felt totally agoraphobia free in the past. I still get pangs of anxiety, tight throat, sweaty hands when driving. Or if I have plans that I feel trapped in, I remind myself I am never trapped and it helps. I feel anxiety about plans still but I refuse to let it stop me.

I am addicted to the chaos I was raised in. Healthy relationships make me uncomfortable and feel dull. Because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no drama. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peaceful and content. I never learned healthy intimacy/love and finally experiencing it is incredibly uncomfortable and feels wrong. It makes the inner critical voice scream extremely loud and all my trauma responses start flooding me saying it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so used to the dysfunction.

            "Those are not what friends are meant to be. When you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re damaged as much as we are with C-PTSD we tend to repeat cycles - we go after emotionally unavailable/abusive people (codependency) or we put people off because we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dealt with our trauma. We find it safer to seclude ourselves than to open up to true intimacy because it makes us uncomfortable. We never received or knew true tender emotional love/care and some never felt parental love at all. We were neglected and so we accept this pattern of neglect, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand up to it, and in the end attract more of it because we have not dealt with our underlying trauma. Some of the time, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if this is the case with OP, I wondered why no one ever reached out to me and I was mad and depressed because I had no socialization. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand why I never could form deep friendships. Then I realized it was because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to form bonds and intimacy at all that wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t toxic/avoidant. I would run away, ignore texts, not open up, seclude myself until people just stopped trying to invite me because - I never showed up. Relationships do go both ways and require emotional vulnerability on both ends. If you view yourself as flawed and that no one will like you if you are the real you, you will always keep people at arms length out of fear. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say OP is suffering from avoidant attachment and freeze trauma response. OP needs to focus on shifting their world view from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople will abandon me, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get close, no one likes me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am worth loving and healthy relationships, I can set boundaries, and people will like me for who I actually am rather than putting on a show\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t capable, we never learned how to connect emotionally and were abused when we tried. We are damaged and our brains have learned it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s safer not to try than to potentially be abused or abandoned again.

            "I think the void is the sadness we feel for never having the intimacy and love we deserved. Idk your story or if childhood abuse caused your C-PTSD but for a lot of us we feel empty because we lack parental acceptance and love. We were neglected on a deep emotional and spiritual level. We need to grieve the loss of this childhood right for ourselves and be compassionate during it. Letting yourself feel your feelings - anger, sadness, denial is important to helping heal the void. Then you can work on mending it by filling the hole with love for yourself and parenting yourself in a way your parents never did. Highly recommend inner child work for this.",

Gynecologists typically will put you on birth control and blow you off. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in the medical field with experience as a lab tech so here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the recommendation I would do: transvaginal ultrasound. Bloodwork including: testosterone (free and total), estrogen, progesterone, DHEAs, OGTT (with insulin levels tested fasting and post-prandial), prolactin, cortisol, A1C, LH, FSH, TSH/Thyroid profile, AMH, and SHBG. That gives you a comprehensive hormonal baseline to go from and decide if things are out of whack. The ultrasound may reveal cysts but they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t totally necessary as long as you have 2/3 criteria: symptoms, cysts on imaging, or off bloodwork. The treatment for mine that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on is Metformin 1,000mg, Ozempic 0.5mg (titrating up to 1mg slowly), and Lo Loestrin Fe birth control. Birth control helps add estrogen and progesterone to your system while the others balance insulin and the Metformin can lower testosterone/androgens. Spironolactone is another common PCOS medication as it lowers testosterone and can help with hirsutism and acne. Another option if you struggle with PCOS-like symptoms but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get these medications is Ovasitol as this mimics the benefits of Metformin. Since these medications, I have had two natural periods, lost weight, and feel so much better.",

            "You can take Metformin during pregnancy but Spiro has to be stopped as well as BC.",
            "I personally have good success with Lo Loestrin Fe or the combination pill like Norethindrone/Ethinyl Estradiol + Ferrous Fumarate is the generic since the brand name is very expensive.",
            "Firstly, I would start with therapy. You really need to try to undo some of that damage the bullying did to you. That way becoming a healthier weight/treating your body kindly will come easier as the mind will be healthier too. Second, a reproductive endocrinologist would be best. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll likely start you on Metformin which works wonders for a lot of women when trying to conceive with PCOS. They may also induce a bleed with a medication called Provera to shed out old lining as not having a period in a long time can cause uterine cancer. If Metformin doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work, they may try Clomid to conceive. But definitely a reproductive endocrinologist is the best of the best for this as they focus on hormonal issues preventing fertility.",
            "I would highly recommend going to a endocrinologist to treat your PCOS in addition to the Inositol (which is great but not quite as strong as medication). You likely have severe insulin resistance on top of the pre-diabetes that needs addressing and addressing that will likely help your appetite which will help you lose weight without feeling restricted. That PCOS is probably causing a lot of the binging/restriction issue. You should also try to find an eating disorder counselor as it sounds like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re suffering with disordered eating which is very common in PCOS. Orthorexia specifically. I have PCOS myself and I used to ALWAYS feel hungry no matter what because of IR and I could eat for like 3-4 people. I suffered the same as you did. No shocker I put on 100+ lbs in a short period of time. Treating my underlying medical issue really freed me of the disordered eating as I feel my mind is clearer and know I can lose weight without my body fighting me constantly. I feel now I can eat healthily and still loss weight rather than restricting severely.",
            "I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so happy for you! I do take the pill in combination with Metformin and Ozempic and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still been able to lose weight and I do feel the pill is helping me as well but I know that varies. I had low estrogen, low SHBG, and high testosterone so I felt it was needed as well.",
            "Insulin tests, fasting and 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test with blood sugar and insulin read at the 2 hour mark. Ideal fasting insulin is under 5, mine was 43. 2 hours insulin, my endocrinologist said should be under 50, mine was 447. Blood sugar was always normal, and A1C is 5.4%.",
            "She/he is definitely not informed all the way. My reproductive endocrinologist recommended it to me in addition to the medication but she did say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not quite as strong or effective as medication.",
            "I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on week 2 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost 5 lbs! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been great so far, but it seriously reduces my appetite, I have to remind myself to eat because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel hunger. A little nausea on day 3 after my shots and a little constipation so I make sure to eat fiber.",
            "No, there are different forms of PCOS. Insulin resistant PCOS is just the most common type.",
            "As far as I know, Metformin is lifelong for us with PCOS.",
            "Whoop! That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still riding the excitement of getting my period, which still feels so weird to be excited about, lol. What dose are you on? 1,000mg was really key for me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed a lot more positive change since going up.",
            "Only a few months, maybe 2-4 months.",
            "Getting your hormones balanced helps. I lost 50-80% of my hair from PCOS and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on Metformin, Ozempic, and birth control, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s starting to regrow now.",
            "It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s helps by balancing your hormones out some. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lowers blood sugar/insulin resistance, lowers testosterone/androgens which are the cause of hirsutism and lack of ovulation. Hyperhydrosis I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure it will help with. But Inositol is a great tool for PCOS and I highly recommend it, especially if you have insulin resistant PCOS.",
            "Mine was rotated and massively infected, still didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel a thing with removal!",
            "I take Ozempic and Metformin together and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been working beautifully. I am not diabetic but have pretty severe IR.",
            "Yes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good baseline. I personally, as a lab tech, would want fasting insulin, oral glucose tolerance test with insulin, LH, FSH, and AMH.",
            "I would recommend he definitely see a doctor to rule out anything serious like a DVT. But for what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth, the human body isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perfectly symmetrical and it could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always been there if you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t measured his calves before. Especially since he is not having symptoms. Myself, my calves are 16\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and 18\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, definitely not even.",

            "I wish I had advice. I was never in treatment for restriction but I suffered from Anorexia and Bulimia in the past and now I have BED. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common as disordered eating is disordered eating. Try talking to an eating disorder specialist.",
            "I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have T2D and I take Ozempic and in one week I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m down 3 lbs so it helps massively. But I am insulin resistant and have PCOS so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how I got it covered. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $35/month with my insurance. Without they have a copay card for $25/month copay.",
            "No. I just said not to.",
            "Removal was totally fine for me, but insertion OH BOY. I am also traumatized from the pain of insertion. I did not take any pain relief for removal but the doctor did give me some Valium to calm me before. Maybe they can do this? Removal was the easy part, trust me.",
            "It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normal, negligible result. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it.",
            "I did it and I had liquid fiery diarrhea for about 4-5 hours but otherwise I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m okay, lol. I had about half a beer.",
            "Oh you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be alright in the mean time! I had a lot more symptoms and I am still untreated for it tbh and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m perfectly okay, waiting months to see my neuro-ophthalmologist. :)",
            "Definitely, haha. I had to do the same and grab a bottle. Kaopectate also works well and I find it regulates the diarrhea without stopping me up + treats heart burn and nausea. As long as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interact with other medications, you can try that too. :)",
            "If if helps I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had this for about 5-6 years and went untreated and undiagnosed totally. I just thought my symptoms were normal. So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be just fine until your appointment. \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f",
            "Yes basically, easy to treat unless severe and you may need a brain shunt but less common. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m still not sure if fixing the hormonal imbalance improves the outcome but anecdotally I will say getting my IR and hormones in check I noticed my visual symptoms have slowed a LOT. So no more flashes or weird pressure feelings in my head.",
            "I had to get my hormones balanced and insulin resistance under control. Nothing short of that helped me with my binging, I could just eat and eat and eat like I was eating for 3-4 people and gained 100 lbs over a few years from it. I felt like there was something wrong with me. But now that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on medication for it, I eat totally normally and can forget to eat which never happened before. Seriously it makes a HUGE difference.",

            "When it was still new I had a fairly normal cycle meaning it came every month but was erratic - heavy, light, early, late, but at least it happened once a month. As time went on and my insulin and hormones got worse it stopped coming and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have one for 6 months and wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have unless I used Provera to induce bleeding. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably early on in the disease or hormones are only slightly out of range.",
            "Hahah, I did the same so I felt that! I also take Ozempic and that constipates you so maybe that could be an option to help balance you out if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much? Or ask about extended release if the pooping doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get better, lol. I heard some people do better on extended! Best wishes and happy bowel movements, hahaha.",
            "Nah cause literally I had a few days like that! \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x80\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure how far into taking it you are but the side effects calmed down after a week or two for me.",
            "I currently take 1,000mg a day and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honestly been fine! I would say avoid alcohol though while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re adjusting, I drank half a beer on my birthday and it gave me awful diarrhea! Otherwise I just burp and fart a lot and sometimes get a little reflux but nothing serious that my stomach issues didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t already cause. Occasionally I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get mildly loose stools or a little constipated but nowhere near as bad as my IBS gives me. I pre-medication have GERD, IBS-M, gastritis, and possible ulcers and hernias so I was very worried about taking Metformin. It was actually not bad though! I do take mine with a meal though and be prepared for a bowel movement about 1 hour after taking if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not extended release. I do also take Ozempic 0.25mg and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure which did it but I lost 3 lbs this week. Metformin did suppress my appetite though.",
            "Yes I experienced bad GI effects so I cut my dose down to 1/4th and worked up slowly, each added increment doing it for a week or two before moving up. Had no issues after that.",

I also have IBS-M so none of this is new to me and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to tell what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-existing and what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Metformin. But it has been amazing for weight loss and IR. Welcome to my literal shit show! \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x85",

In some immune compromised people, the induration can be larger and still be negative. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfortunately impossible for me to tell if this is a negative or positive over pictures as it requires me touching it.",

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also taking Metformin 1,000mg. I also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any more hypoglycemic episodes from my insulin resistance anymore which is HUGE for me as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had them daily for 4 years now. I felt some ovulation pain starting (I should be ovulating now) so here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to hoping I get my period!!!! I also tried Inositol which was good too (although made me very nauseous and I had to work up very slowly) and it felt like a milder Metformin/Ozempic.",

I get the feeling your household was tense and people did not talk about the hard emotions in life like anger and depression. These things were hushed and covered up - this comes out in the dream in the form of no talking but the boy understanding you. This is a subconscious desire from childhood - to be understood on a mental level by (probably) a father figure in your life. You still feel on some level you have not grown out of your childhood because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having a hard time coming to terms with how you grew up, you feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfair and that there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno end in sight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the suffocation you felt growing up. Even in this dream, you are being responsible for an empty red wagon which does not benefit you in any way in the dream. It seems you had more responsibility than should be expected of a child growing up. You feel you were punished for being a kid and feel you cannot get in touch with that sad, lonely inner child that still lives inside you. As with all dream interpretation, if this does not resonate with you, this is not the correct interpretation. This dream will likely continue until you find the subconscious cause of it and address it. Perhaps therapy would be good to digest your childhood.",

Since acting was something you used to enjoy and now you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at it, it would suggest you feel out of sorts with your old interests and hobbies. Back to the point of not being in touch with your emotions/societal norms, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccramming\\xe2\\x80\\x9d could symbolize the external pressure from the world you may be feeling about your future choices/life choices/career choice, and you feel you can fake it or lie about how you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re feeling but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interested in doing. To me, the acting aspect of this dream would symbolize the unconscious or emotional side of your life, you may feel you are failing there.

He was wearing a large black backpack on his back and possibly a walking cane? He definitely gave me the impression he was a hitchhiker/nomad of some type.

His hair was short, almost like an overgrown buzz cut. He furrowed his brow and just stared at me until I woke up into a panic attack. \\n\\nCan someone please explain what the hell this was about?

This can come in the form of verbal reassurance or physical actions taken. This may seem temporarily gratifying to the individual who is experiencing anxiety or negative emotions. In the long run, however, it perpetuates feelings of not being able to trust your own judgment and the need for reassurance may become more and more intense or frequent. There are many different types of reassurance loops, but the most common with Health Anxiety are asking other people if they experience similar symptoms, asking for others to calm them down during periods of high distress, and body checking.

            "So for reference I am not suicidal so I have no idea why this dream. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in some house with a 12 gauge shotgun. And I put it under my chin and shoot myself. But here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kicker, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t die. I wake up and call 911. The EMTs get there and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m injured for some reason. Then I show them the top of my head. It blew the top of my skull out and half my brain but I retained the right hemisphere of my brain. So I get taken to the ER and treated and basically I am still alive and functioning but I struggle with basic tasks a little more. Then I woke up. I felt no pain during this dream and it seemed like there was a reason I shot myself but cannot remember. Any ideas?",
            "This one is a bit odd. But I had this dream a few days ago. I was in my basement and there was a random guy there who broke in. I wanna say he was about my height with blonde or balding hair and tattered type of dress but the details are fuzzy now. He had a power drill with a massive drill bit on it. I was trying to figure out how to deal with him when my Mom comes in drunk off her ass. She goes up to this guy and is kinda egging him on in drunk fashion. So he sticks the drill to her stomach and turns it on. At first it catches the fabric and spins it up not hurting her. I kinda relax relieved it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drill into her. But then she says something to the guy and so he drills harder, causing some scratches and pain. Still not enough to seriously injure her. At this point I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to pull her away from the dude. Before I can, he presses the drill one last time and it drills straight through her abdomen and out her back. I can see this massive (2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) drill bit sticking out her back. He stops for a minute as she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in shock. Then continues with the drill and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m freaking out because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s twisting her intestines all up. Then I wake up. Any ideas what the HELL this means?",
            "So I just woke up after a dream last night. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep all that well but basically I was living with some roommates I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize as someone in real life in this dream. Takes place in a childhood home I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live in anymore for relevancy. We were having a casual conversation outside while we were watching I think some little kid on Valentine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day in the dream? Well there was roses I was holding that my grandpa had given me at some point during the dream while we were talking. Anyway this person was a male (medium build, brown semi-bowl cut hair, shorter than me by a little, had this smug looking face) and he just kept criticizing everything I said or did. Like I went to put the flowers in the compost area cause they were wilting along with some trimmed off hair I guess. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember exactly what this guy said but it was rude and I remember saying something like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yea, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fair point but I leave the hair for the birds to nest with!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It seemed like even though he was criticizing me at first I was trying to maintain a peaceful encounter for the sake of living together. But eventually I got sick of his constant criticism and so I went off of him and basically said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for you to give a shit about anyone other than yourself but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really tired of you constantly shitting on everything I do or say. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cost you anything to take 4 minutes out of your day to be nice to me. I understand you probably had a really privileged cozy upbringing where you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the decent thing to do to be kind to others\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the gist of my little rant to him. He looked stunned like no one had ever said that shit to him and I stormed off irritated and annoyed throwing the rest of my flowers I had on the ground. Pretty sure that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when I woke up. For even more context, I am not a shy person in waking life. I can be confrontational when need be and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind standing up for myself or others so it seems odd to me to have a dream about this?",
            "I just woke up from a nap and I had a lovely but equally disturbing dream. My grandmother died in 2013 from aggressive breast cancer that spread through her whole body and I did witness her basically dying. I was young when this happened but old enough to remember it. \\nAnyways, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cut to the dream world. It was taking place in the house she died in. I was sitting on our living room floor with my grandfather (still alive irl) and watching television. I was facing a dark hallway that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually there in the real house. I suddenly see someone come out of the bathroom and cross over to their bedroom. I say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNana?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she turns and looks at me. (During this dream I am aware that she should not be alive still). She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in a night gown, maybe a pink one, and looks like herself but gaunt and pale. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember exact details here but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on about how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to die soon anyway\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that they were wrong when they thought she was dead and that she had a little more time left. So she starts walking into the living room in front of me and trips and falls onto the rug on the floor. I yell, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNana!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and go to help her up. I scoop her up in my arms like a baby and am holding her near my face sort of. Up close she looks way aged beyond her years, leathery, and extremely gaunt and emaciated. She seems annoyed with still being alive. But I tell her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and start crying. She says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI love you, too\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and I just continue to cry while holding her. Then out of nowhere there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suddenly a fireplace at the foot of where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sitting and I start smelling something weird. It takes me a few minutes to realize we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both on fire but mostly me. My grandma got put out pretty quickly. I am rolling around panicking, on fire, and I embarrassingly had to strip off my pants in front of everyone in this dream. Then I think I got it out but I woke up right about then choking and coughing in real life. Help?",

            "So back in January 2020 I had the worst panic attack of my life. Like I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had one since then even come close to how horrific and traumatic that panic attack was. Until 2 days ago. I had the exact adrenaline rush, no trigger type panic attack while out driving. Previously, it would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve kept me inside for who knows how long or I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been able to move on. In 2020, after that panic attack I avoided the area it happened in for 6+ months and could barely go 5 minutes to the gas station. But nope! I decided it was just a panic attack, did breathing exercises, talked to someone to distract me, pulled over, waited out the symptoms, and kept going. I desperately wanted to drive home (since I was already driving when it hit). But I decided my anxiety WOULD NOT stop me that day. So I went down my January 2020 panic trigger road right after my recent panic attack. I went and visited my family and stayed for 4 hours. And I was totally FINE. I did that and I am very proud of the progress!",
            "So as you can imagine I wanted to get my shots to protect from Covid-19. Well I was raised by an anti-vaxxer and was also falling for the media scaring the daylights out of me reporting on all kinds of crazy and terrifying rare side effects. But against my anxiety, I spontaneously booked my appointment. As time drew closer, I became more and more anxious, CONVINCED I would be the special 0.1% with crazy side effects. Well, I get the shot and did the 15 minute waiting period. Nothing. Maybe a small twinge of pain from getting a shot but nothing happened. I continued being anxious for the rest of the night. Woke up still kicking and totally fine. Still nothing. I had a slight sore arm for a few hours and the mildest leg aches of any illness I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had. Seriously a regular cold is FAR worse than the shot. Anyways what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying is, we get so caught up in our anxiety but we neglect that we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as special as we think. We are more likely to be the 99.9% that is fine than the 0.1% or 0.0005% that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I am a week out from my first dose and absolutely NOTHING horrible has happened to me like I assumed would. And I am a very unhealthy at risk person. So if I can do it and am fine, you will be okay!",

Those are straight ideals, cues that straight people use to find others like them. Binary centrism that treats femininity as the flipside of masculinity, traits that must be balanced with each other.\\n\\nBoth of my partners are different gender than me, as a nonbinary person, but we treat them like gay, same gender relationships, so when we dress up for cons and stuff like that we emphasize similarity in gender. We have a schoolgirl gang costume that we do and we're also going to dress lolita. I think both of those are also archetyped gender expressions that help an audience go beyond making the connection of femininity > woman.\\n\\nI liked the other commenter's idea of vaudeville style mixing masc and femme traits in both of you. You can take that idea into any costume you choose. And maybe you can take some inspiration from drag, including techniques that AFAB queens or drag kings use.

ED is a combination of many unresolved problems, coping mechanisms and trauma respons strategies. When not dealt with emotions can run really high and especially in a relationship. She might need lots of validation, feel insecure, it might affect going out for meals and socialising. Read all you can about it and being there even when there\\'s nothing to say, or solve right away. You might experience anger at times and helplessness. If she\\'s open for change that\\'s good. And there might be fall-backs so what I\\'m saying is its not gonna go away just like that...it can take years...keep communicating and don\\'t censor your emotions.

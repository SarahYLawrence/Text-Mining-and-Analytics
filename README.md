### Task 3 - Measuring the Severity of Signs of Eating Disorders

#### Overview:
Task 3 is a continuation of the previous year's Task 3, focusing on estimating the level of features associated with a diagnosis of eating disorders based on user submissions. Participants are provided with a history of postings from users and are required to fill out a standard eating disorder questionnaire based on the evidence found in the postings.

#### Questionnaire:
The questionnaire used in Task 3 is based on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), which is a 28-item self-reported questionnaire adapted from the semi-structured interview Eating Disorder Examination (EDE). However, only questions 1-12 and 19-28 are used in this task. These questions are designed to assess the range and severity of features associated with a diagnosis of eating disorders, covering four subscales: Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern, and Weight Concern, as well as a global score.

#### Data Processing:
1. **Text Extraction**: Text data is extracted from user submissions provided in the form of threads or postings.
2. **Questionnaire Completion**: Participants are tasked with filling out the standard eating disorder questionnaire based on the evidence found in the history of postings. The questionnaire includes questions 1-12 and 19-28 of the EDE-Q.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The extracted text data and completed questionnaires are processed and formatted for analysis.
4. **Analysis and Estimation**: The severity of features associated with a diagnosis of eating disorders is estimated based on the completed questionnaires and other relevant data.

#### Output:
The output of Task 3 includes:
- Completed questionnaires for each user, detailing the severity of features associated with eating disorders.
- Analysis reports summarizing the severity levels and any insights gained from the data analysis.

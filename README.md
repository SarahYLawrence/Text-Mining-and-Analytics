according to their relevance to the set of BDI (Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory) depression symptoms. 
A sentence is considered a BDI symptom when it displays information about the user's state concerning the symptom.

- Tokenized using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 
- Joined the tokens

Model:
- Universal Sentence Encoder -> Edited_Project
- Roberta -> Edited_Project_bert

Similarity:
- Normalized embeddings
- Calculates the dot product (Comparing user posts embeddings with severe BDI options embeddings and using np.dot() to find the similarities between them)
